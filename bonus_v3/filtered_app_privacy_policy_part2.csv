What kind of cookies does eHarmony use?
Strictly necessary cookies
We use certain cookies to make sure that our website and our Service is easy, secure and safe to use. Without these cookies, services that you have asked for (such as a secure website and Service), would not be possible. This category of cookies includes:
Personal Information We Receive from Others. In addition to personal information you provide us directly, and that we collect automatically, we also may receive personal information from:
Fraud-detection and credit-reference agencies to correct our records and help prevent and detect fraud;
Sources that are available to the public, which we might combine with information that we collect from you directly; and
A family member or someone else acting on your behalf.
We encourage users to refer a friend to our Service by sending us a friend’s name and email address. We will send that person a one-time e-mail containing your name and inviting them to visit our site. This e-mail will contain a contact-address to send their request if they want to unsubscribe. We will not keep information about your friend in our database after the email has been sent. If you refer a friend, you agree that you will not abuse this feature by entering names and addresses of those who would not be interested in eharmony’s Services. For some of our Services, you may also give gift memberships to your friends, in which case we will use your friends’ e-mail address that you provide in order to deliver the gift.
2. How and Why We Use Your Personal Information
We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, to:
Provide, improve and secure our Services;
Establish and manage user accounts, such as your “My Profile”;
Display the public fields of your profile to your potential partners, including recent login date, user name, photos, videos, and other profile content;
Provide customer support, troubleshoot issues, manage our Services, and respond to requests, questions, and comments;
Process transactions;
Communicate with you about our Services, including order confirmation, refund and renewal processing, notifying of matches for our Singles Service, Service announcements and administrative messages;
Communicate with you regarding promotions, including newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts and event notifications. Our communications may include advertisements and other third-party promotional materials, campaigns and tools.;
Conduct market and consumer research and trend analyses;
Enable posting on our blogs, forums, and other public communications;
Perform accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation, and collection activities including collecting on outstanding and past due account balances;
Prevent, detect, identify, investigate, and respond to potential or actual claims, liabilities, prohibited behavior, and criminal activity;
Comply with and enforce legal requirements, agreements, and policies;

One of the methods we use to communicate with you in connection with eHarmony’s Services may be by telephone or text message (including to any wireless number you may provide to us). For example, you may sign up for a text messaging service (“SMS Verification”) which enables eharmony to verify your phone number via a confirmed text message and display such verification in your public account (as a security measure for your potencial partners’ benefit). If you would rather not receive telephone calls or text messages from us, you may change or delete your number from your account preferences page(s), or ask to be removed from our contact list if you receive a call or text message from us. You may also opt-out of the SMS Verification service please send us an e-mail at any time. Please note that we or one of our service providers may contact you by telephone in connection with an outstanding and past due balance on your account. Opting out of receiving telephone calls will not opt you out of receiving calls related to an outstanding balance.
In addition to the uses outlined above, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to allow us to anonymously use the information from you and your experiences to continue our research into successful relationships. This research, conducted by psychologists and behavior research scientists, may be published in academic journals. However, all of your responses will be kept anonymous, and no personal information will be published.
3. Mobile Push Notifications
We will send you push notifications if you choose to receive them for purposes of receiving notice of potencial partners for our Service, letting you know when someone has sent you a message, or for other Service-related matters. If you wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications you may turn them off at the device level.
4. If Information is Not Provided
If you do not provide us with the personal information we request, this may limit our ability to fulfil the applicable purpose for collection and the services we are able to provide you.

If you cannot provide us with such information, we will ask you to provide other account information to verify your identity.
We will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to, correct, or delete your data when you request it, but there may be circumstances in which we may not provide access to, correct, or delete data as allowed by law.

Also, we are not required to provide access to information that contains legal privilege, if your identity could not be verified, or where the information would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, like intellectual property rights. If we determine that your request for access, deletion, or correction should be denied or restricted for any reason , we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries.
Authorized Agent

5. ¿Para qué usamos tus datos personales?
1. Para poder ofrecerte nuestro servicio y conectarte con otros usuarios.
Uno de los aspectos más importantes del servicio mobifriends es precisamente la recogida y el tratamiento de los datos personales de los usuarios para que cuando realizas una búsqueda de otros usuarios se te muestren los usuarios que tengan un perfil más compatible contigo. Por esto, cuantos más datos introduzcas, y cuanto más acordes sean éstos con la realidad, mayor será la posibilidad que los resultados que te ofrecemos en las búsquedas sean relevantes para ti.
Dado que la finalidad esencial de introducir los datos en tu perfil es que otros Usuarios puedan verlos, es inevitable que estos otros usuarios accedan a dichos datos a través de las plataformas de mobifriends. Además de comunicar los datos a los Usuarios registrados que realicen las búsquedas también se dará acceso a los Usuarios no registrados. No obstante, los datos que se ofrecerán a los Usuarios no registrados cuando realicen una búsqueda serán un resumen de los datos del perfil. Los datos considerados por la legislación ""especialmente protegidos"" como el ""origen racial"" o la ""religión"" no se ofrecerán en las búsquedas resumidas que se mostrarán a los Usuarios no registrados.

We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the next interactive GmbH. The use of the Internet pages of the next interactive GmbH is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the next interactive GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
As the controller, the next interactive GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.
1. Definitions
The data protection declaration of the next interactive GmbH is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:
a) Personal data Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
b) Data subject Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.
c) Processing Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
d) Restriction of processing Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
e) Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
f) Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
h) Processor Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
i) Recipient Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
j) Third party Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
k) Consent Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
2. Name and Address of the controller

27321 Thedinghausen
Germany
Email: privacy@choiceoflove.com
3. Cookies
The Internet pages of the next interactive GmbH use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, the next interactive GmbH can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.
4. Collection of general data and information
The website of the next interactive GmbH collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, the next interactive GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the next interactive GmbH analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
5. Registration on our website
The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.
By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in this data protection declaration, as well as the entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.
6. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.
7. Rights of the data subject
a) Right of confirmation Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.

b) Right of access Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information: the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.
c) Right to rectification Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.
d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary: The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the next interactive GmbH, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of the next interactive GmbH or another employee shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately. Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. The Data Protection Officer of the next interactive GmbH or another employee will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.
e) Right of restriction of processing Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the next interactive GmbH, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of the next interactive GmbH or another employee will arrange the restriction of the processing.
f) Right to data portability Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer designated by the next interactive GmbH or another employee.
g) Right to object Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The next interactive GmbH shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. If the next interactive GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the next interactive GmbH to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the next interactive GmbH will no longer process the personal data for these purposes. In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the next interactive GmbH for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact the Data Protection Officer of the next interactive GmbH or another employee. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent. If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the next interactive GmbH shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision. If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data Protection Officer of the next interactive GmbH or another employee of the controller.
i) Right to withdraw data protection consent Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time. f the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data Protection Officer of the next interactive GmbH or another employee of the controller.
8. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook
On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.
A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.
The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the ""Like"" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.
The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.
9. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google AdSense
On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdSense. Google AdSense is an online service which allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites. Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements displayed on third-party sites to match with the content of the respective third-party site. Google AdSense allows an interest-based targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by means of generating individual user profiles.
The operating company of Google's AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
The purpose of Google's AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website. Google AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Alphabet Inc. is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google AdSense component is integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google AdSense component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Alphabet Inc. gains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission settlements.
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc. from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. Additionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc. may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
Furthermore, Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis through which a statistical analysis may be performed. Based on the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc. is able to determine if and when a website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by the data subject. Tracking pixels serve, inter alia, to analyze the flow of visitors on a website.
Through Google AdSense, personal data and information—which also includes the IP address, and is necessary for the collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements—is transmitted to Alphabet Inc. in the United States of America. These personal data will be stored and processed in the United States of America. The Alphabet Inc. may disclose the collected personal data through this technical procedure to third parties.
Google AdSense is further explained under the following link https://www.google.com/intl/en/adsense/start/.
10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.
The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.
For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application ""_gat. _anonymizeIp"". By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.
The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.
11. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords
On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google's search results only then displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account the previously defined keywords.
The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED STATES.
The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of third-party advertising on our website.
If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion cookie loses its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system, were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of goods.
The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that could identify the data subject.
The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired settings.
Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.
12. Legal basis for the processing
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
13. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
14. Period for which the personal data will be stored
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
15. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
16. Existence of automated decision-making
As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.

Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.
We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.
We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.
We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!
We work hard to keep your information secure. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.

Welcome to BLK's Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 2018
Please see our California Privacy Statement to learn about California privacy rights.
WHO WE ARE If you live in the United States or Canada, the company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the ""data controller"") is:
Affinity Apps, LLC
8750 N. Central Expressway, Suite 1400
Dallas, TX 75231
WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by BLK. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our ""services"" in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we've added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services. Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below. Information you give us You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes: When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth. When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered ""special"" or ""sensitive"" in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information. When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information. When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials. When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter. If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service. If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request. Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services. Information we receive from others In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including: Other Users Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you. Social Media You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your BLK account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us. Other Partners We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance when BLK accounts can be created through a partner's websites (in which case they pass along registration information to us) or where BLK ads are published on a partner's websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign's success). Information collected when you use our services When you use our services, we collect information about which features you've used, how you've used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details: Usage Information We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you've been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive). Device information We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including: hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device' settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address); information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength; information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses. Other information with your consent If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren't using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).
COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a ""Do Not Track"" (""DNT"") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including BLK, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together with practical examples. To administer your account and provide our services to you Create and manage your account Provide you with customer support and respond to your requests Complete your transactions Communicate with you about our services, including order management and billing To help you connect with other users Analyze your profile and that of other users to recommend meaningful connections Show users' profiles to one another To ensure a consistent experience across your devices Link the various devices you use so that you can enjoy a consistent experience of our services on all of them. We do this by linking devices and browser data, such as when you log into your account on different devices or by using partial or full IP address, browser version and similar data about your devices to help identify and link them. To serve you relevant offers and ads Administer sweepstakes, contests, discounts or other offers Develop, display and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our services and other sites Communicate with you by email, phone, social media or mobile device about products or services that we think may interest you To improve our services and develop new ones Administer focus groups and surveys Conduct research and analysis of users' behavior to improve our services and content (for instance, we may decide to change the look and feel or even substantially modify a given feature based on users' behavior) Develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new interests-based feature further to requests received from users). To prevent, detect and fight fraud or other illegal or unauthorized activities Address ongoing or alleged misbehavior on and off-platform Perform data analysis to better understand and design countermeasures against these activities Retain data related to fraudulent activities to prevent against recurrences To ensure legal compliance Comply with legal requirements Assist law enforcement Enforce or exercise our rights, for example our Terms To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases: Provide our service to you: Most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you. Legitimate interests: We may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so. For instance, we analyze users' behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes. Consent: From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users' information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users' information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others. With other users You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you're comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it. If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings. With our service providers and partners We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations. We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners. We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations. With other Match Group businesses BLK is part of the Match Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes websites and apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24, OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click here). We share your information with other Match Group companies to benefit you in two respects: for other Match Group companies to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Assistance provided by other Match Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding how our service is used and users' behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
In order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse. Examples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we feel would be interesting to you based on your search criteria. We may also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws. We may also share user information with other Match Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior. In some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms. For corporate transactions We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control. When required by law We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person. To enforce legal rights We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing. With your consent or at your request We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information. We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.
CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (""EEA""), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.
YOUR RIGHTS We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools: Access / Update tools in the service . Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that's associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here. Device permissions . Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. Deletion . You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service. We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember: Reviewing your information . Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here. Updating your information . If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth. Uninstall . You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities. Accountability . In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this notice, please submit your request here. Please allow 30 days for a response. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures. We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately here.
HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account, unless: we must keep it to comply with applicable law; we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law; there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account. Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES Because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.",

La protection de votre vie privée est au cœur de la conception et de l’élaboration des services et des produits que vous connaissez et appréciez, afin que vous puissiez leur faire pleinement confiance et vous concentrer sur vos nouvelles rencontres.
Nous sommes tout à fait conscients de la confiance que vous nous accordez en nous partageant vos informations et nous ne prenons pas cette marque de confiance cela à la légère.
Notre engagement concernant la confidentialité de tes données. Nous concevons tous nos produits et services en ayant le respect de votre vie privée à l’esprit. Nous faisons appel à des experts de différents secteurs, notamment le droit, la sécurité, l’ingénierie et la conception de produits, pour nous assurer que toutes nos décisions sont prises dans le plus grand respect de votre vie privée.
Notre engagement en termes de transparence. Parce que nous utilisons bon nombre des mêmes services en ligne que vous, nous savons que le manque d’informations et un langage trop compliqué sont des problèmes courants dans les politiques de confidentialité. Nous adoptons exactement l’approche inverse : nous faisons de notre mieux pour rédiger notre politique de confidentialité et les documents associés dans un langage simple. En effet, nous voulons que vous lisiez nos politiques et compreniez nos pratiques en matière de confidentialité !
Notre engagement envers la sécurité. Nous avons des équipes dédiées à la protection et à la sécurité de vos données. Nous mettons constamment à jour nos pratiques en matière de sécurité et investissons nos efforts concernant la sécurité pour renforcer la protection de vos informations.

POLITIQUE DE CONFIDENTIALITÉ
Bienvenue dans la politique de confidentialité de MEETIC. Merci de prendre le temps de la lire.
Nous sommes conscients de la confiance que vous nous portez en nous partageant vos informations et nous avons l’intention de toujours conserver cette confiance. Cela commence par nous assurer que vous comprenez les informations que nous recueillons, les raisons pour lesquelles nous les recueillons, la manière dont elles sont utilisées et les choix qui s’offrent à vous concernant ces informations. La présente politique décrit nos pratiques en matière de confidentialité des données dans un langage simple, en limitant au minimum le jargon juridique et technique.
Cette politique de confidentialité s’applique à partir de 13/12/2022.
La version précédente de cette politique de confidentialité, disponible ici , s’applique jusqu’à cette date.
1. QUI SOMMES NOUS
La société responsable de vos données (« Responsable de Traitement ») en vertu de cette politique de confidentialité est :
Meetic S.A.S.
MEETIC
53 rue de Châteaudun Paris 9 FRANCE
2. OÙ S’APPLIQUE LA PRÉSENTE POLITIQUE DE CONFIDENTIALITÉ
La présente politique de confidentialité s’applique aux sites internet, applications, événements et autres services que nous exploitons sous la marque MEETIC. Par souci de simplicité, nous désignons l’ensemble de ces services par le terme « services » dans la présente politique de confidentialité. Afin de rendre cela très clair, nous avons ajouté des liens renvoyant à cette politique de confidentialité sur tous les services auxquels elle s’applique.
Certains services peuvent disposer de leur propre politique de confidentialité. Si un service possède sa propre politique de confidentialité, alors c’est cette dernière — et non la présente politique de confidentialité — qui s’applique.
3. LES INFORMATIONS QUE NOUS RECUEILLONS
Il va sans dire que nous ne pouvons pas vous aider à faire des rencontres sans disposer de certaines informations à votre sujet, telles que les informations de base sur votre profil et le type de personnes que vous souhaitez rencontrer. Nous collectons également des informations sur la façon dont vous utilisez nos services, telles que les journaux d’accès, ainsi que des informations provenant de tiers, comme lorsque vous accédez à nos services via votre compte sur un réseau social ou lorsque vous téléchargez des informations à partir de votre compte de réseaux sociaux pour compléter votre profil. Nous vous donnons plus de détails ci-dessous.
Les informations que vous nous fournissez
Lorsque vous utilisez nos services, vous choisissez de nous communiquer certaines informations. Par exemple :
En créant un compte, vous nous fournissez au moins vos identifiants de connexion ou votre numéro de téléphone, ainsi que certaines informations de base nécessaires au fonctionnement du service, tels que votre genre et votre date de naissance.
En complétant votre profil, vous pouvez partager avec nous des informations supplémentaires, telles que des détails sur votre personnalité, votre style de vie, vos centres d’intérêts et d’autres détails vous concernant, ainsi que des contenus tels que des photos et des vidéos. Pour ajouter certains contenus, comme des photos ou des vidéos, vous pouvez nous autoriser à accéder à votre appareil photo ou à votre galerie photo.
En vous abonnant à un service payant ou en effectuant un achat directement sur nos plateformes (plutôt que par l’intermédiaire d’une plateforme telle qu’iOS ou Android), vous nous fournissez, à nous ou à notre prestataire de services de paiement, des informations, telles que votre numéro de carte de débit ou de crédit ou d’autres informations financières.
Lorsque vous participez à des sondages, des groupes de discussion ou des études de marché, vous nous donnez votre avis sur nos produits et services, vos réponses à nos questions et vos témoignages.
En choisissant de participer à nos promotions, événements ou concours, nous recueillons les informations que vous utilisez pour vous inscrire ou participer.
Si vous contactez notre service clientèle, nous recueillons les informations que vous nous fournissez dans le cadre de cette interaction.
Si vous partagez avec nous des informations concernant d’autres personnes (par exemple, si vous utilisez les coordonnées d’un ami pour une fonctionnalité donnée), nous traitons ces informations en votre nom afin de répondre à votre demande.
Bien sûr, pour assurer le bon fonctionnement du service, nous traitons également vos conversations avec d’autres utilisateurs ainsi que le contenu que vous publiez.
Les informations que nous recevons des tiers
En plus des informations que vous pouvez nous fournir directement, nous recevons des informations vous concernant de la part de tiers, notamment :
Les utilisateurs
Les utilisateurs peuvent fournir des informations vous concernant lorsqu’ils utilisent nos services, par exemple lorsqu’ils interagissent avec vous ou lorsqu’ils font un signalement vous concernant.
Les réseaux sociaux
Vous pouvez décider de partager des informations avec nous via votre compte sur un réseau social, par exemple si vous décidez de créer ou de vous connecter à votre compte MEETIC via votre réseau social ou un autre compte (par exemple, Facebook, Google ou Apple) ou de télécharger sur nos services des informations telles que des photos provenant de l’un de vos comptes sur les réseaux sociaux (par exemple, Facebook, Instagram…).
Les affiliés
MEETIC fait partie du la famille d’entreprises Match Group. Match Group considère la sûreté et la sécurité des utilisateurs comme une priorité absolue. Si vous avez été banni d’un autre service de Match Group, vos informations peuvent être partagées avec nous pour nous permettre de prendre les mesures nécessaires, notamment supprimer votre compte ou vous empêcher de créer un compte sur nos services.
Autres partenaires
Nous pouvons recevoir des informations à votre sujet de la part de nos partenaires, notamment lorsque des comptes MEETIC peuvent être créés par le biais du service d’un partenaire (auquel cas ils nous transmettent les informations d’inscription) ou lorsque des publicités MEETIC sont publiées sur le service d’un partenaire (auquel cas ils peuvent transmettre des informations sur le succès d’une campagne). Lorsque la loi l’autorise, nous pouvons également recevoir de tiers des informations sur des personnes soupçonnées ou reconnus coupables d’actes malveillants ou d’infractions dans le cadre de nos efforts pour assurer la sécurité de nos utilisateurs.
Informations générées lorsque vous utilisez nos services
Quand vous utilisez nos services, des données techniques sont générées sur les fonctionnalités que vous avez utilisées, la façon dont vous les avez utilisées et les appareils que vous utilisez pour accéder à nos services. Voir ci-dessous pour plus de détails :
Données d’utilisation
L’utilisation de nos services génère des données sur votre activité sur ces derniers, par exemple la manière dont vous les utilisez (par exemple, le moment où vous vous êtes connecté, les fonctions que vous avez utilisées, les actions effectuées, les informations qui vous ont été présentées, l’adresse des pages web qui vous ont redirigés chez nous et les publicités avec lesquelles vous avez interagi) ou encore sur vos interactions avec d’autres utilisateurs (par exemple, les utilisateurs avec lesquels vous vous connectez et interagissez, le moment de l’interaction, le nombre de messages envoyés et reçus).
Informations sur l’appareil
Nous collectons des informations à partir de et sur le(s) appareil(s) que vous utilisez pour accéder à nos services, notamment des informations relative à vos équipements et logiciels telles que l’adresse IP, l’identifiants et le type d’appareil, les paramètres et les caractéristiques des applications, les pannes de l’application, les identifiants publicitaires (qui sont des numéros générés de manière aléatoire que vous pouvez réinitialiser en allant dans les paramètres de votre appareil), les identifiants associés aux cookies ou d’autres technologies qui peuvent identifier de manière unique un appareil ou un navigateur.
Autres informations avec votre consentement
Si vous nous en donnez la permission, nous pouvons recueillir votre géolocalisation précise (latitude et longitude). La collecte de votre géolocalisation peut avoir lieu en arrière-plan, même lorsque vous n’utilisez pas nos services, si l’autorisation que vous nous avez donnée permet expressément cette collecte. Si vous vous n’acceptez pas que nous collections votre géolocalisation précise, nous ne le ferons pas. De la même façon, si vous y consentez, nous pouvons recueillir des photos et des vidéos (par exemple, si vous souhaitez publier une photo ou une vidéo ou utiliser des fonctionnalités de streaming sur nos services). En outre, si vous choisissez de participer à notre fonctionnalité de vérification par selfie, nous recueillons vos données de géométrie faciale, qui peuvent être considérées comme des données biométriques dans certains pays, pour vérifier que c’est vraiment à vous que nous avons affaire. Vous pouvez en savoir plus sur la vérification par selfie et sur la façon dont nous traitons vos données de géométrie de visage ici.
4. COOKIES ET AUTRES TECHNOLOGIES SIMILAIRES DE COLLECTE DE DONNÉES
Nous utilisons et pouvons autoriser des tiers à utiliser des cookies et autres technologies similaires (par ex., des balises web, des pixels, des SDK) pour vous reconnaître et/ou reconnaître votre ou vos appareil(s). Vous pouvez consulter notre Charte d’utilisation des cookies pour plus d’informations sur les raisons pour laquelle nous les utilisons et sur la manière dont vous pouvez mieux contrôler leur utilisation.
Certains navigateurs web (dont Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox et Chrome) disposent d’une fonctionnalité « Ne pas suivre » (« Do Not Track, DNT ») qui indique à un site internet qu’un utilisateur ne souhaite pas que son activité en ligne soit suivie. Si un site internet qui répond à un signal DNT reçoit un signal DNT, le navigateur peut empêcher ce site internet de recueillir certaines informations sur l’utilisateur du navigateur. Tous les navigateurs ne disposent pas d’une option DNT et les signaux DNT ne sont pas uniformisés. Pour cette raison, de nombreuses entreprises, y compris MEETIC, ne répondent pas à l’heure actuelle aux signaux DNT.
5. COMMENT NOUS UTILISONS VOS INFORMATIONS
La principale raison pour laquelle nous utilisons vos informations est de fournir et d’améliorer nos services. Par ailleurs, nous utilisons vos informations pour assurer votre sécurité et pour vous proposer des publicités susceptibles de vous intéresser.

6. COMMENT NOUS PARTAGEONS VOS INFORMATIONS
Puisque notre objectif est de vous aider à faire de nouvelles rencontres, le principal partage des informations des utilisateurs se fait, bien entendu, avec d’autres utilisateurs.

Nous nous conformerons bien entendu à la loi applicable et, le cas échéant, nous vous informerons de toute opportunité de ce type, en vous permettant de l’accepter ou de le refuser. Il peut s’agir, par exemple, de la création d’un nouveau service au sein de Match Group, s’adressant à un groupe démographique spécifique qui, selon nous, pourrait vous intéresser en raison de votre profil.

7. TRANSFERTS TRANSFRONTALIERS DE DONNÉES
Le partage d’informations décrit à la Section 6 implique des transferts transfrontaliers de données vers les États-Unis d’Amérique et d’autres juridictions qui peuvent disposer de lois différentes en matière de traitements des données. Lorsque nous transférons des informations personnelles en dehors de l’EEE, du Royaume-Uni, de la Suisse ou d’autres pays dont les lois sur la protection des données ont été jugées adéquates par la Commission européenne ou tout autre organisme gouvernemental compétent, nous utilisons des clauses contractuelles types (les clauses contractuelles types sont des engagements entre les entreprises qui transfèrent des données personnelles, les obligeant à protéger la confidentialité et la sécurité de vos données) ou tout autre mécanisme de transfert approprié. Nous sommes actuellement en train de revoir nos transferts vers nos prestataires et la base légale associée suite au récent arrêt de la Cour de justice de l’Union européenne sur les transferts de données personnelles vers les États-Unis.

(“Hily” or “we”).
This Policy is an integral part of the Hily’s Terms of Use (the “Terms”) and incorporated by reference into them. Please read this Policy carefully and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at legal@hily.com. In case you have any ongoing questions about how to exercise your rights, etc., you may also contact us at support@hily.com.
Some services which may be employed by either Hily or you to interact with the Services may have their own privacy rules (third-party privacy policies). Thus, if your personal data is processed by such services, such processing is governed by third-party privacy policies, not this present Policy.
This Privacy Policy explains what personal data is collected when you use the our mobile applications and websites, and the services provided through them, how such personal data will be processed.
By using our service/app, you promise us that (i) you have read, understand and agree to this privacy policy, and (ii) you are over 18 years of age. If you do not agree, or are unable to make this promise, you must not use the app/service. In such case, you must (a) delete your account and contact us and request deletion of your data; (b) cancel any subscriptions using the functionality provided by Apple (if you are using iOS) or Google (if you are using Android), any other app stores that may be available from time to time, or by us.
Any translation from English version is provided for your convenience only. In the event of any difference in meaning or interpretation between the English language version of this Privacy Policy available at https://hily.com/privacypolicy/ and any translation, the English language version will prevail. The original English text shall be the sole legally binding version.
1. Initial Notice to Users 1.1. Here, at Hily, we strive to protect your privacy. It goes without saying, by being a place for building the best connections between people, that the App exists as a vast social network, where users may share their experiences, show emotions and just be themselves. All of those actions are connected to personal data sharing. Your “personal data” or just “data” means any information linked with you or the one that may identify you directly or indirectly as a person. 1.2. Privacy tips. Despite our best efforts, we cannot control how other users or third-party services may use your data. When using Hily, you should presume that everything you post, share or message on the App may be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Hily users and people outside the App. We want you to be careful about going public with your data, thus, we kindly ask you to follow our privacy recommendations as below: (a) when you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share is determined at your own risk. (b) you share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the Service (including your Hily profile). That is why we recommend and encourage you to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. Please be careful with your data and make sure that the information you publish is data you feel comfortable being publicly viewable; (c) we do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ license details, precise location and other important data on your Hily profile or send that data via direct messages to people that you do not trust; (d) we do not recommend that you share your sensitive data (religious denomination, sexual preferences, health details, political leanings, any kind of addictions, etc.) with other users. If you really desire to share this data safely (so as to set up more relevant connections, etc.), you may use Hily tags features. Regarding Hily tags, please read section 1.3 hereof to find out the benefits of their use; (e) photos that you share via Hily may reveal much information about you; please inspect all of them for data or objects that you do not want to go public with before you upload or share your photos; (f) please make sure you log out of your Hily profile after use from either your or a third-party’s device since you never know who may get access to them; (g) please do not share your access credentials (login, email, password, phone number, etc.) with Hily or other social media profiles with anyone else; (h) we recommend that you change your Hily and other social media password from time to time; (i) if you think or even have the slightest suspicion that someone may have had access to your Hily or social media profile or access credentials, first of all, change them immediately; if you lost your access to the profile owing to third-party activity, we recommend that you contact us at support@hily.com (if there is no access to Hily profile) or report the issue to the relevant social media platform; (j) we kindly draw your attention to the fact that you are the only person who must care about your access credentials’ safety. Remember that in the event they are compromised, a third party may get your data. We cannot guarantee your data security if you lose control of your account and do not notify Hily about the issue. 1.3. Hily tags and Information filled by you, including sensitive data and location. Instead of sharing some of your data in a text description of your profile, we recommend that you use Hily tags to identify you as a person of a specific style. We find it a more secure and beneficial option since you may change them or hide them anytime you choose. Meanwhile, Hily tags allow you to create better connections with people who may share your views and are more likely to say “hello”. Hily allows you to share information about yourself with, including your location and information that may be deemed “sensitive” or “special category” in certain jurisdictions such as religion, political opinions, philosophical belief. Such information will be collected by Hily and puclibly available in your profile only after your explicit consent. If you do not give your explicit consent to process such sensitive data, we will not show your the tags relating eligion, political opinions, philosophical belief to choose. Still, all any time, you are entitled to make us stop showing that data to others by deleting relevant tags in your profile settings, restricting some users from accessing your profile (in this case just blocked users will not see your data) or requesting the deletion of your sensitive data or other data by contacting at support@hily.com. If you have given Hily access to your location, but wish to turn this off, you can do so by the following methods: iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Hily Android — settings, location, Hily, permissions, location

Legal Bases. Legal bases are the grounds set forth by the GDPR on which we may process your data. We rely on the following legal bases: (a) performing the contract with you — the main legal basis that we use to process your data. It includes mostly everything we do to provide you with services, under our Terms of Use and their appendices. You may restrict us from processing of your data, but please be advised that, in such a case, we will not be able to provide services to you. Please see section 8 to find out more; (b) legal obligation — we may process your data when we have a legal obligation when it is required by applicable laws, e.g., in order to prevent fraud, assist law protection and enforcement bodies. (c) Legitimate interest – we have a commercial interest in processing your personal data that is justified, balanced and does not infringe on your privacy (e.g., statistical reporting). Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to our use of your data. Please see section 8 to find out more; (d) consent — we may process some of your data when we have your consent to do so. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at any time. Please see section 8 to find out more. 5.6. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we may receive your personal data from any third parties (other users, any official bodies, third-party providers, etc.) when you connect your Hily profile with other services, when we receive enquires, court orders, subpoenas, claims, etc. 5.7. We do not collect or store full credit card number information, though we may receive credit card-related information to help process future payments and summary information about transactions that do not include credit card or bank account numbers. 5.8. From time to time, we may start surveys/feedback for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to take part in marketing campaigns. Such activities are optional. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact us at support@hily.com or via the respective in-App feature. If you do not want to contact us but you also do not want to participate in our activities, please ignore our messages. 5.9. Since we rely on your consent to show you personalized ads, you are entitled to revoke your consent anytime and request that we stop using personalized ads towards you. Please contact us at support@hily.com to strike off your consent. Before creating your Hily account, users in the EEA/UK will be presented with a consent preference screen where they can control if their personal information can be used for advertising by our ad/marketing partners. Users in the EEA/UK can also access the Consent Preference Center from within the settings menu of the Hily app at any time. If you are a California or Virginia resident see section 9.3. and 10.4. on how to opt out of personilized/targeted advertising.
Meanwhile, if you opt-out of targeted/personalized advertising you will still see ads, but non personalized advertising. Such non personalized advertising may be based on location that is not classified as personal dta itself.
6. Duration and Location of Processing; Cross-Border Data Transfer 6.1. Data Retention. Your data will be stored within the term of your use of the Services and up to the termination of such use (or upon agreement between you and Hily) which means the deletion, blocking or suspension of your account on the mobile application and the restriction of your further use of the mobile application; we shall terminate the processing of your personal information, unless the special retention period for the storage of such data is set by the relevant legislation at the time. 6.2. Exemptions. We delete or anonymize your information, including sensitive information indicated in section 9.2. for California Residents upon the termination of your profile or after two years of your continuous inactivity. There may be special rules applied in case that: (a) we must hold your data to comply with applicable laws; (b) we must hold your data to evidence our compliance with applicable laws; (c) there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to hold the relevant data until it is resolved; or (d) your data must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users’ safety and security (see section 6.6 hereof). 6.3. Terms of Deletion. All your data is to be fully erased (or anonymized) within 7 calendar days following deletion of your Hily profile, except: (a) livestreams records which are being stored up to 7 calendar days following a date of livestream; (b) in-app features and subscription purchases which are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account; (c) messages between users and support team, support tickets, emails with our support team (as identified in your email), as part of support tickets data that are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account; (d) hashed email address, IP address, profile ID (including, Hily ID, Facebook ID, Snapchat ID, Apple ID) and device ID (NOT a device IMEI) associated with banned account which are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account owing to our legitimate interest (see section 6.6 hereof). 6.4. Leftovers. When your account is deleted (as well as your data) from the Services, copies of your data may still be viewable, if your data has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or other third parties. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your data, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their own privacy policies. 6.5. Removed and deleted data may be hosted in backup copies for up to 30 days, but will not be available to others in the meantime. We put that backup data ‘beyond use’. At the end of this period, these data will be permanently deleted. 6.6. At all times, you are entitled to restrict us from processing your data by sending to us a data erasure request or a notice of prohibition to process your data. Please be warned that: (a) such action prohibits us from processing your data and/or making us delete your data so you will lose your access to the Website and Services; (b) if your Hily profile is banned, a data erasure request will not release you from prohibition to use Hily Services; (c) if your profile is blocked, your other Hily profiles may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures. 6.7. Enforcing of Prohibition to Use Hily. If your profile is blocked, banned or otherwise disabled owing to any violation of applicable law or a violation of the Terms of Use or the provisions of this Policy, you will be prohibited from further creation of new profiles and using the Services again. Accordingly, we will keep on processing data listed in section 6.3(f) hereof (the “technical data”) in order to prevent your further registration and potential violations. Please note that: (a) the technical data is not subject to erasing under Article 17 of the GDPR; hence, we will process it on the basis of our legitimate interest, which is a separate ground of processing. We may also process some technical data of minor users on the basis of our legitimate interest to protect the security or integrity (as considered in COPPA § 312.4(c)(6)) and prevent such minors from accessing to our Service from other accounts; (b) our legitimate interest does not outweigh your right to privacy, because the way that we use the technical data does not significantly impact your privacy, and we have a compelling reason to do so (recital 47 of the GDPR). This reason is to restrict you from breaching yet another obligation under the Hily’s Terms of Use and potentially harming us or our users. 6.8. Location of Servers. Our servers are based in the USA and EU, so your data may be processed and hosted outside the EU. We inform you that we use EU servers to collect and process EU and UK residents’ data and we use USA servers to collect and process data of users from the rest of the countries. If you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States — or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate. 6.9. Cross-Border Data Transfer. The sharing of information laid out in section 5.4 hereof involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. if we transfer personal data collected within the EEA to countries with not adequate level of data protection, we use one of the following legal bases: (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (details available here (or any new version of contractual clauses issued by a data protection body (if any), or (ii) the European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries (details available here). We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses together with additional safeguards to protect your personal data. You can see a copy of these clauses.

You give us consent to process your precise geolocation data when you allow through your mapping phone service as Google Maps to access your location while you are using our App. Please see section 8. 1 (d) above on how to restrict the processing of your geolocation data. 10.3. Exercising your consumer rights: You have the right to request (1) to confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer’s personal data and to access such personal data; (2) To correct inaccuracies in the consumer’s personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer’s personal data; (3) To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer; (4) To obtain a copy of the consumer’s personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; (5) to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising. You may exercise your rights by contacting us at support@hily.com. See more details in section 11 below. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the VCDPA.

We display advertisements to you where such adds are based on personal data obtained from nonaffiliated websites or online applications. You can opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising by contacting us at support@hily.com. 11. Data Subjects’ Access and Erasure Requests 11.1. Method for Submitting Requests. If you are an EU user, you may exercise your right to file a request to access or delete your data by contacting us at support@hily.com or via the App. In the event you are a California or Virginia consumer, you may exercise your privacy rights according to section 9 and 10 accordingly. 11.2. Timeframes. In the event you submit your request to us, we will act as follows: (a) within 10 business days following а confirmation of receipt of your letter, we shall request that you provide us with relevant data for a verification procedure; (b) if you are a California or Virginia consumer, we will have 45 calendar days following the date of your request to process your request. In the event of your failure to pass the verification process within 45 calendar days, we may deny your request or prolong the term of processing up to additional 45 calendar days; please be sure that we will notify you about our decision; (c) if you are an EU or UK user, we will have 30 calendar days following the date that you provide us with the data required for verification to process your request. In the event of your failure to pass the verification process, we may deny your request. We are entitled to prolong the response term up to 2 months by giving you a notification. 11.3. Verification and automated decision-making. The most important step is the verification process. We will first check that we have enough information to be sure of your identity. Often, we will have no reason to doubt a person’s identity (if you contact us via the App, for example). In most case we use a combination of the automated system and a team of moderators to verify the users` identity and users are not robots. And we also want to avoid fake Hily accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Hily network and spoil things for everyone. If you choose to verify your profile photo, our automated system will scan each photo that you submit. So, automated decision-making is necessary in order to help ensure that you are who you say you are before entering into a contract with you. This ultimately assists our efforts to prevent and respond to illegal, malicious, and unauthorized activity. We do not add the verification photos to your profile. If we have good grounds to doubt your identity, we may ask you to provide additional evidence we reasonably need to confirm your identity. For example, we may ask you for a piece of information held in your profile that we would expect you to know: your location, last 5 connections, etc. If we have serious doubts about your identity, we may ask you to share with Hily your photo with your ID document or an image of your ID document. In the event you fail the verification process, your request will be rejected.

A. Public Record Information
Please be aware that home sales and purchases may be a matter of public record, and your name and address, the price you paid, your property taxes, and other information may be available from public sites regardless of the brokerage(s), if any, who assist in the transaction. We post on our Sites some information that typically becomes part of the public record of a home sale or purchase.

We share information obtained from you, MLSs and other third-party sources that is not on the public record to facilitate your home purchase or sale transaction. This includes:
Service Providers to all Redfin Clients : Our agents work with third parties to process your home search and sale transaction and must share your information with those third parties. Examples include MLSs and providers of software used for document preparation and electronic signing.
Partner Agents : A Partner Agent is employed by or works with another brokerage and is not a representative or employee of Redfin. Partner Agents have contracted with us to provide Redfin-quality service to a wider range of customers. We'll refer you to a Partner Agent at our discretion. If you are referred to a Partner Agent for your home purchase or sale transaction, we share your information with that Partner Agent so they can assist you. Redfin is not responsible for the work performed or the services provided by Partner Agents in any manner.
Home Seller Service Providers : As is customary as your home sales agent, we share your listing information with MLSs and other listing websites, such as Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com.

Home Buyer Service Providers : As is customary as your home purchase agent, we must share your buying information with inspectors, title companies, escrow agents, closing attorneys, lenders, and other third parties as needed to process your transaction.

The dispute shall be presented to a single arbitrator (the ""AAA Arbitrator"") sitting in a site located in Boca Raton, Florida. The AAA Arbitrator shall be selected jointly by you and the Company within fifteen (15) days after demand for arbitration is made by Company. If the parties are unable to agree on an AAA Arbitrator within that period, then either party may request that the AAA select the AAA Arbitrator in accordance with its then existing rules and regulations. The AAA Arbitrator shall possess substantive legal experience in the principal issues in dispute. Any discovery permitted shall be limited to information directly relevant to the controversy or Dispute in arbitration. In the event of discovery disputes, the AAA Arbitrator is directed to issue such orders as are appropriate to limit discovery in accordance with the foregoing and as are reasonable in light of the issues in dispute, the amount in controversy, and other relevant considerations. To the extent the parties are unable to agree on the scope of discovery, the AAA Arbitrator shall require the party seeking discovery on an issue to present the legal and factual basis for the Dispute and shall permit the party opposing discovery to respond. The AAA Arbitrator shall permit discovery on an issue only if the AAA Arbitrator concludes that there is a reasonable and good faith basis in law and in fact for bringing such allegations and that the discovery appears likely to present substantive evidence regarding that Dispute. The AAA Arbitrator may permit limited discovery to permit investigation of some of the Disputes or to determine whether a Dispute has sufficient basis in law or in fact to warrant further discovery, but shall issue appropriate orders to restrict the scope of such discovery. The federal and state rules of procedure and evidence shall not apply to the arbitration proceedings, including without limitation the rules of discovery. The AAA Arbitration shall consider claims of privilege, work product and other restrictions on discovery as appear to be warranted. The AAA Arbitrator shall award the prevailing party its attorney's and expert's fees and disbursements incurred in resolving the dispute and shall award double costs and expenses or other actions to the extent the AAA Arbitrator finds any Dispute advanced in the proceedings to be frivolous or without a good faith basis in fact and in law when such Dispute was first presented for arbitration. Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing between the parties or as ordered by the AAA Arbitrator upon substantial jurisdiction shown, the hearing for the dispute shall be held within ninety (90) days of Company’s submission of the dispute to arbitration. The AAA Arbitrator shall render a final award within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of the hearing and any required post-hearing briefing or other proceedings ordered by the AAA Arbitrator. The AAA Arbitrator shall state the factual and legal basis for the award. The decision of the AAA Arbitrator shall be final and binding, except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1. et seq., and except for errors of law based on the findings of fact. Final judgment may be entered upon such award in any court of competent jurisdiction, but entry of such judgment shall not be required to make the award effective. YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVE ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
Limitation of Time to File Claims. ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE APPLICATION MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES OTHERWISE SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.

Third Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising.

To learn more about our advertising practices and your choices relating to advertising, please see “Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising.”
Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising
We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our websites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may play or display ads on our services, on other websites, apps, or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”), which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, device ID or AdID, geolocation, and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an e-mail address or user ID) or hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners may use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) or work with third-party partners who use tracking technologies or statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices (including to improve your user experience), to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.
In some of our offerings, including our mobile applications, we provide you with the option of logging in using an account that you may have with a social-media service, such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. For this type of log-in, you will be directed to the appropriate social-media log-in page, where you will enter your username and password (or account credentials) for the social-media service. (Through a social-media log-in, the social media service may know when you have used our offering.) The social media-service will then send us a token, which we will use to authenticate you for access. The social-media service may also share your name and email address with us, although we will not have access to your social-media account credentials. We may keep the token and your name and email address for purposes of identifying you, which enables us to maintain your preferences in our offering across different devices. As an example, by identifying you using this information, we can present to you your previous searches and saved properties in our mobile applications, even if you access the applications from different devices. Keeping this information also makes it possible for us to pre-populate your name and email in certain interfaces, such as log-in fields or contact forms.
Your Choices

Please note that opt-outs are browser specific, so opting out on one browser will not affect a second browser, or device.

3. Sharing Your Information
We do not rent or sell your personal contact information (such as your email address associated with your account registration) to third parties to use for their direct marketing purposes. We share personal information in the following ways:
Platform Visitors and Users
One of the main purposes of having a Houzz account is to share home renovation and design ideas with others. Through Houzz, others have the ability to find, contact, view, and follow your profile and public activity on Houzz (for example, if you ""like'' content on our Platform or if you create an ideabook and do not mark it private) and link it to your username. You can customize your Houzz profile and whether users may follow you through your Houzz settings. Your Houzz content (for example, ideabooks, photos, notes on others' photos, projects, discussions, and social media profiles), followers, and others you follow are publicly viewable on the Platform and open to comments by other Houzz users. If you would like to make certain of your content private, please click here for more information. If you are a professional, or merchant on Houzz, we may also display the following information in order to help visitors and users evaluate you: aggregated information on our Platform about your Platform activity (e.g. response rate), and information that is publicly available from third parties.
Professionals, Merchants, and Other Businesses on our Platform
If you request us to find professionals for you, your project information (including the contact information) that you provide will be made available to a limited number of professionals that we believe may be suitable for your project. Such professionals are independent from Houzz and their use of your data is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Professionals and merchants that participate on the Houzz Platform may view your public activities on our Platform and receive feedback you provide to us about your engagement with them. For example, if you requested us to find professionals for you and provide us feedback about your level of interest in these professionals, we may convey such feedback to them. In addition, a professional or merchant can view your public activities on our Platform that are interactions with their content (for example, that you added one of their photos to your non-private ideabook on a particular date, as identified by the username for your profile and any photo or public identifiers you provide for your profile). When you receive messages from professionals through the Platform, Houzz and the professionals can track your interaction with these messages, including whether you opened the messages or documents shared with these messages. A professional or merchant cannot see your non-public account information or see private activity (for example, if your ideabook is private).
Service Providers and Partners
We may share your information with service providers and partners as reasonably needed for our uses described in this Privacy Policy, including entities that help us sell and deliver products to you, such as merchants, payment service providers, logistics professionals, delivery and freight companies, and entities that host data for us or help us understand user behavior on our Platform. You can find more information here about our service providers and partners with which we may share your information. Only if you specifically agree to share your contact information with a third-party partner, for example, as part of a contest or promotion we sponsor with such a third party, will we share your contact information with that third-party partner for their direct marketing purposes.
In addition, we may share information about you with third-party platforms when you allow the third-party platform to receive this information from us or allow Houzz to share this information with the third party. Our Platform may include third-party social media features and other third-party plug-ins and widgets. When these features are displayed on our Platform, they are operated or hosted by third parties. We are not responsible for these third parties and third-party platforms, so please carefully review their privacy policies and your permissions granted to these third parties and platforms. For example, you may sign-up for our Platform through Facebook, Google, or Apple.
Advertisers and Ad Networks
We use advertising networks and partners to serve advertisements for us and other businesses, including interest-based advertising, on third-party sites and to assist us in evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising. We may also work with advertising networks and partners to serve ads on our Platform and to communicate with you at the addresses they have for you. We may provide advertising networks, advertising partners, and businesses advertising on our Platform with aggregate information but other than hashed information or device identifiers, we do not disclose your name, contact information, or other personal information. For example, we may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to advertising networks (e.g., Facebook and Google) to serve advertisements to you or others. To opt-out of the use of your information for this purpose, please send a request as provided under the Contact Us section.
We and the businesses advertising on our Platform, advertising networks, and advertising partners may also use cookies or similar technologies to track your activities on our Platform and other online properties in order to provide you with tailored ads across websites, apps, and devices and to understand how those ads perform. To learn how to opt-out of receiving this type of advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.
Corporate Affiliates and Business Transfers
We may share information from or about you with (a) joint ventures or other companies in the Houzz Group, or (b) a potential or actual acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in bankruptcy or similar proceedings). In these cases, their use will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
Legal Obligations
We may disclose information from or about you, as required or permitted by applicable law, if we believe that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us, a service provider, or a partner (which may include disclosure to law enforcement, courts, or governmental authorities); (b) prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with our Platform; (c) protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our visitors, users, corporate affiliates, or the public; or (d) enforce compliance with our agreements with you (for example, the Houzz Terms of Use).
4. Communications
An essential part of our services that you sign up for when you create an account on our Platform is to receive communications from us or our professional partners through email, phone call, and text message, or through our Platform. If you use our mobile app, these communications also include push notifications. We communicate with you about your account, privacy, use of the Platform, including interactions with your content (for example, if others ""like"" your ideabook, respond to your comment, or if you earn a badge on our Platform), news relating to the Platform, its features and industry developments, and communications concerning promotions run by us or third parties. We also ask for your feedback about your experience in connection with our Platform or about your home renovation and design plans. In accordance with applicable law, we or our professional partners may send you marketing communications (e.g., with tips, offers, and similar services). These communications may feature us, our Platform, co-branded products and services, professionals, merchants, and other businesses on our Platform.
If you provide us your phone number, we and our professional partners may call you or send you text messages to help you with using the Platform (e.g., to discuss your home remodeling or design project, to find professionals, or to assist with your order or if you are a professional, to find products or to provide you tips about your professional profile). If you are a professional or other business, we may use your contact information (whether publicly available or provided to Houzz) to call and otherwise contact you about our Platform, including to market and sell our products or services or those available on our Platform.
You may change your communication preferences at any time through your Houzz settings if you have a Houzz account and your Ivy settings if you have an Ivy account, and you may also opt-out of similar types of marketing emails from us directly through the email. To opt-out of our text messages at any time, you can follow the instructions provided in the text message, which typically is to reply “STOP.” You may opt-out of sales and marketing phone calls from us by letting us know during the call or by contacting us as described in the Contact Us section. Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving necessary account- and privacy-related messages from us. If you wish to stop receiving push notifications from us, you can turn off push notifications for the mobile application in the settings of your mobile device.
Our Platform also allows you and others to send messages and make calls in our Platform, share content with others outside our Platform, and if you make your contact information available, for others to contact you outside of our Platform.
5. Your Choices and Rights
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond to your request securely and efficiently.

To deactivate your account on the Ivy Platform, please follow the instructions here or contact us as described in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.

In order to request permanent deletion of the personal information associated with your account, please contact us as described in the Contact Us section.
We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we are processing your personal information unless the law permits or requires us to retain your personal information for a longer period. For example, we may need to keep your personal data to provide services on our Platform or to defend future legal claims. We also will retain de-identified information after your account has been deleted. Information you have shared with others will remain visible after your account has been deactivated or deleted and after the information has been deleted from your own profile or account. We do not control information or content that others have copied out of our Platform. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may continue to reside in our systems for a period of time, and we may maintain copies of this information as part of our business records.
7. Children
Our Platform is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information. If you become aware or believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section.
8. Data Security

10. Contact Us
If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy (including about the manner in which we or our service providers treat your personal information), you may contact us in the following ways:
If you are an Ivy user, please email us at support@ivy.co;
if you are a Houzz user and a resident of the European Economic Area, please email us at EUprivacy@houzz.com;
all other Houzz users, please email us at privacy@houzz.com.
You may also reach our Privacy team by mailing us at our address at Houzz Inc., 285 Hamilton Avenue, 4th Floor, Palo Alto, California 94301, USA, Attn: Privacy.
11. International Transfers of Personal Information
Houzz may process your personal data among affiliates of the Houzz Group outside your local jurisdiction. Many of Houzz's third-party processors also are based in different jurisdictions.
Historically, Houzz has complied with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information (as defined in these Frameworks) transferred from countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom (”UK”), and Switzerland, as applicable, to the United States. On July 16, 2020, however, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as “invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result of that decision, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States. That decision does not relieve participants in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield of their obligations under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
We may receive from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland some or all of the information listed in the Collection of Information section of this Privacy Policy. Some of that information may qualify as personal information. We may use the personal information we receive from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy or as you may otherwise be notified. In case we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we will make sure that (a) the recipient is based in a jurisdiction that the European Commission has decided maintains an adequate level of protection for personal data, or (b) the recipient has enacted appropriate safeguards under Article 46 of the GDPR (such as for example Binding Corporate Rules or EU Standard Contractual Clauses).
Onward Transfer
In the Sharing Your Information section of this Privacy Policy we describe our data sharing practices. We may also be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may use third parties to process data on our behalf as described in this Privacy Policy.
Access and Choice
EEA, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to them. As an individual from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you may also request to correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal information, should direct their query as provided in the Contact Us section.
You can manage your profile and settings within our Platform.
Dispute Resolution
European Union, UK, and Swiss individuals with privacy inquiries or complaints should please contact us first as described in the Contact Us section.
12. Additional Information for Individuals in California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut
This section provides notice and specific information to consumers in California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut, including information required by the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively ""CCPA""), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Consumer Privacy Act (effective July 1, 2023), and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (effective July 1, 2023). Please note that the notice, information, and rights for residents in Colorado and Connecticut are only effective July 1, 2023.
We share information with third-party partners to display personalized ads and content on other platforms, for which you have the right to opt-out. You may opt-out of sharing your personal information for these purposes by visiting “Your Privacy Choices” located in the footer of this website, or by adjusting your account settings here. Additionally, you may use an Opt-out Preference Signal or Universal Opt-out Mechanism to notify us of your privacy preference. We will recognize your opt-out preference, as opting-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information with third parties as defined by applicable law. We will apply your opt-out preference only to the browser or device used to signal your preference. When you login to our Platform, we will apply your opt-out preference to your account.
As provided in our Terms of Use, use of the Houzz Platform by anyone under 18 years of age is strictly prohibited. Consequently, we do not knowingly disclose information regarding individuals under 18 years of age to third parties in exchange for consideration. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those set forth in the CCPA.
In addition to the rights described above and in the Your Choices and Rights section, California residents may also, subject to certain exceptions, request us to provide information about how we have used and shared your personal information. Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut also have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information. Residents of Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut have the right to confirm whether Houzz is processing their personal information. Please submit these requests for information, as well as requests to access, correct, or delete your information, through this online support form, through your privacy settings, or by emailing us at privacy@houzz.com. Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut may appeal Houzz’s decision regarding their request by contacting us at privacy@houzz.com. If we deny your request, we will notify you and provide our reasons for the denial and instructions regarding the rights you may have under applicable laws to appeal the decision. If the appeal is denied, we will notify you of your rights under applicable laws to contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint. Consistent with applicable privacy laws, except to the extent reasonably related to the value of your personal information, we will not treat you differently for exercising your rights under these laws.
Your authorized agent may exercise your data protection rights on your behalf via this online support form or by emailing us at privacy@houzz.com. We may still require you to directly verify your identity and confirm that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request. Whether you submit your request directly or through an authorized agent, generally, the only means Houzz has to verify your identity is for you to respond to a specific Houzz email from the Houzz support team from the email address associated with your Houzz account or to click a confirmation or similar button in a specific Houzz email from the email address associated with your Houzz account.

Third Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising.

To learn more about our advertising practices and your choices relating to advertising, please see “Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising.”
Third-Party Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising
We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our websites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may play or display ads on our services, on other websites, apps, or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”), which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, device ID or AdID, geolocation, and other information. We may share a common account identifier (such as an e-mail address or user ID) or hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners may use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) or work with third-party partners who use tracking technologies or statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices (including to improve your user experience), to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.
In some of our offerings, including our mobile applications, we provide you with the option of logging in using an account that you may have with a social-media service, such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. For this type of log-in, you will be directed to the appropriate social-media log-in page, where you will enter your username and password (or account credentials) for the social-media service. (Through a social-media log-in, the social media service may know when you have used our offering.) The social media-service will then send us a token, which we will use to authenticate you for access. The social-media service may also share your name and email address with us, although we will not have access to your social-media account credentials. We may keep the token and your name and email address for purposes of identifying you, which enables us to maintain your preferences in our offering across different devices. As an example, by identifying you using this information, we can present to you your previous searches and saved properties in our mobile applications, even if you access the applications from different devices. Keeping this information also makes it possible for us to pre-populate your name and email in certain interfaces, such as log-in fields or contact forms.
Your Choices
As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able to set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. You may be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). Please note that opt-outs are browser specific, so opting out on one browser will not affect a second browser, or device. Moreover, if you buy a new device, use a different browser, or clear all your cookies, you will have to opt out all over again. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. Note that some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you may need to opt-out again.

Information Safety Safeguards
We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. We have put in place the following security procedures and technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal data:
Your personal data is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities.
All data saved in the back-end is classified into different levels based on the importance and sensitivity of the data, e.g. whether the data contains personal data.
In the data centers, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology, and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.
Data exchanged between PRIME devices and servers are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”).
There is an optional two-step verification process when users access their PRIME Account.
There is regular review of information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
Access is restricted to PRIME employees and Third Party Service Providers who need to know that the information in order to process it, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations.
There are also access controls for all server clusters used for cloud-based data storage and process.
Most data used for PRIME’s products and/or services is stored in a storage system. By using column family based access control mechanism, PRIME employees are only allowed access to the data column families they are granted access to.
Please note also that for the above, PRIME may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by PRIME to process or back up your personal data. Currently, PRIME has data centers in Beijing and Singapore. As a result, we may transfer to and store your personal data at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Information safety is very important to us. We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal data. Through our protective measures above, especially encrypted storage and transmission, your data is as secure as it can be. Certain details of encrypted data cannot be accessed by anyone except by you.
When this Privacy Policy applies
Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products and services offered by a third party. PRIME products and services may include third party’s products or services. When you use such products or services, they may collect your information too. For this reason, we strongly suggest you to read the third party’s privacy policy as you have taken time to read ours. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third parties use personal data which they collect from you. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites linked from our services.

Nevertheless, it is our policy not to require personal data from minors or offer to send any promotional materials to persons in that category. PRIME does not seek or intend to seek to receive any personal data from minors. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided PRIME with personal data without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the personal data is removed and unsubscribe them from any of the applicable PRIME services.

VI. Personal Information Rights and Choices – State Privacy Rights
Certain state jurisdictions (California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah) provide their legal residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. Each right includes the ability to make a specific consumer request and corresponding obligation of the receiving party to (i) verify the identity of the requestor and (ii) respond in accordance with statutory guidelines. This section describes your rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Accessing and Updating Personal Information
In the event your personal information is determined to be outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, you may access and update your information by logging into your RealPage Services account or contacting your property manager. If you require verification that your requested changes have been completed, and such verification is not readily displayed in your RealPage Services account, you may request confirmation at the email address listed below (See “Contact Us”).
Access to Specific Information Regarding Personal Information Use/Disclosure and Portability
You have the right to request a summary of the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information over the past 12 months. Under most circumstances, this request for disclosure should be submitted to the property manager that operates your apartment community or rental property. As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
However, eRenterPlan, eRenterDirect, Lease Term Solutions, DepositIQ, and ResidentDirect consumer requests should be submitted directly to RealPage. In response to a verifiable consumer request for these services, we will disclose the following information for the applicable RealPage Services:
The categories, specific types, and sources of personal information we collected about you.
Our business purpose for collecting the personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information and the purpose for the disclosure.
You also have the right to request a copy of this personal information in a readily useable format that is transferable to other entities (frequently referred to as “data portability”). If you make a data portability request, RealPage may be (i) restricted from providing certain sensitive personal information in response to the request or (ii) prohibited from granting the request entirely if it presents an unreasonable security risk.
Deletion of Personal Information
You have the right to request that RealPage delete any of your personal information that we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Under most circumstances, this request for deletion should be submitted to the property manager that operates your apartment community or rental property. As stated above, RealPage is merely a service provider for our Clients, and we do not control the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
However, eRenterPlan, eRenterDirect, Lease Term Solutions, DepositIQ, and ResidentDirect consumer requests should be submitted directly to RealPage.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete or de-identify (and direct our service providers to delete or de-identify) your personal information from our records, unless one of the following exceptions applies:
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for RealPage or our service providers to:
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide the RealPage Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you or your property manager, or otherwise perform our contract with you or your property manager. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. Debug RealPage Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us or our Clients. Comply with laws, regulations, statutes, codes, ordinances, or other legal obligations. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Provide sufficient information that allows us to confirm your identity as the person about whom we collected personal information (and, if applicable, the authority and identity of an authorized representative).
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices (including to improve your user experience), to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.
In some of our offerings, including our mobile applications, we provide you with the option of logging in using an account that you may have with a social-media service, such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. For this type of log-in, you will be directed to the appropriate social-media log-in page, where you will enter your username and password (or account credentials) for the social-media service. (Through a social-media log-in, the social media service may know when you have used our offering.) The social media-service will then send us a token, which we will use to authenticate you for access. The social-media service may also share your name and email address with us, although we will not have access to your social-media account credentials. We may keep the token and your name and email address for purposes of identifying you, which enables us to maintain your preferences in our offering across different devices. As an example, by identifying you using this information, we can present to you your previous searches and saved properties in our mobile applications, even if you access the applications from different devices. Keeping this information also makes it possible for us to pre-populate your name and email in certain interfaces, such as log-in fields or contact forms.
Your Choices
As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able to set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device.

is the browser and operating system being used. 740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.
For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.
Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. Learn more
If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more.
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.
For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more
For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.
For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
Right to object to processing: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
Right to data portability: You have the right to have your personal data that we store and/or process sent to other data controllers and/or processors.

This privacy policy and agreement (""Privacy Policy"" or ""Policy"") covers how we collect, use, and treat personal information that you may provide through our website (the ""Website"" or the ""Site"") or while using the Facilities on our Website (the ""Facilities""). Our Terms and Conditions of Use (the ""Terms"") govern your use of the Site. The terms ""you"" and ""your"" refer to any visitor to the Website, including: (i) casual visitors to our Site who have limited access to the Facilities (""Visitors""), and (ii) registered members of our Site including: (a) new members, (b) paid members; and (c) VIP members (collectively, ""Members"" unless indicated otherwise). The terms ""DashBoardHosting"", ""we"" and ""us"" refer to DashBoardHosting, LLC.
1. Your Consent
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully; once you consent to this Policy's terms, it creates legal obligations on you and on DashBoardHosting. We ask you to show your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy in different ways, depending on your relationship to the Site. The procedures for consenting to this Policy are (i) less formal if you are simply a casual Visitor, and (ii) more formal if you are seeking to become a Member of the Site.
1.1. Consent by Visitors. By accessing and using our Website as a Visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our Site.
1.2. Consent by Members. If you register as a Member, you will be prompted to click an ""I Accept"" button linked to this Policy during the registration process. Clicking ""I accept"" confirms your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
2. The Types of Information You may Provide
Information you may provide while visiting our Site or using our Facilities falls into two broad categories (i) personally identifiable information, and (ii) aggregate information. We use the term ""Personally Identifiable Information"" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you including, for example, your name, address, e-mail address, age, photograph, or any combination of this or similar information. ""Anonymous Information"" is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of our Facilities or the pages on our Site that you visit most frequently. These two categories of information can be further divided into (a) information that we collect from you, and that you provide to us (""Site-Directed Information""), and (b) information you intend to provide or make available to other Members or Visitors on our Site (""Member-Directed Information""). Our Privacy Policy governs all Site-Directed Information—whether this information is Personally Identifiable Information or anonymous information—and does not govern Member-Directed Information, as we have no direct control over the collection or use of Member-Directed Information.
3. Site-Directed Personally Identifiable Information; Our Uses of this Information
We will not share Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Website with any third party, other than as expressly disclosed in this Policy. We collect information from Visitors and Members at different points on our Website and through our Facilities, and use this information as follows:
3.1. Registration Information; Usernames. In order to participate as a Member and to use our Facilities, we require that you complete the registration process. The registration process asks you to: (i) create a username, (ii) create a password, (iii) verify that you are at least 18 years old, (iv) provide an email address, (v) provide your zip code, (vi) specify the country in which you reside, (vii) state your physical features such as: (a) height, (b) weight, and (c) age; and (viii) supply information about yourself and what you're hoping to discover by being a member of our Site. We also give you the option of providing your full name, which helps us should you forget your password. The registration process provides you with a username and password, which allows you to gain access to the Website and Facilities depending on the type of membership that you have obtained. Our system relies on usernames as the public ""identifier"" for the each Member.
3.2. Billing Information. After completing the registration process and receiving approval of your user profile, you may become a Paid Member by paying a membership fee. Paid Members have broader access to, and enjoy more flexible use of, our Site. We provide several different payment methods including electronic payment and more ""traditional"" payment methods such as mailing a check or money order. DashBoardHosting handles electronic payments by submitting billing information that you provide on our Site to a third party vendor. Any billing information sent by DashBoardHosting to our third party vendor is intended solely to allow said third party to process payment. Any personal information that we collect when processing payments made through ""traditional"" methods will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information.
3.3. Email Addresses. You have the option of opting-in or opting-out of receiving e-mail notifications relating to our Site, including for example, notifications that you have received a message from another Member.
3.4. Communications with Other Members. By registering on the Website, Members indicate an interest in exchanging information with other Members, subject to any Privacy Controls imposed. We seek to limit the information provided through our system to the minimum information needed to identify a participant in communications and other exchanges. To allow such communications, we provide information to identify individual users, in the form of Members' username, gender, height, weight, and a link to their user profile.
3.5. Other Information Exchanges. The Website allows Members (i) to provide and receive information in a range of forms and on a variety of topics, and (ii) to engage in other activities through Website discussions that may include, at the option of the user, an exchange of Personally Identifiable Information. In these instances, we use any information you provide to us strictly for the purposes for which you submit the information.
3.6. Use of Profiles in Promotions. We believe that our Members' own experiences on the Site can often act as the strongest promotion for the Site and our Facilities. To promote and illustrate the Site and our Facilities, therefore, we may wish to post on our homepage, and in other areas of the Site, Member profiles and other information that our Members provide to us. To this end, we provide ""mini-searches"" in which Visitors performing searches will be able to see a synopsis of your profile, and an image from your profile may be displayed on our homepage. Moreover, if you create an external profile, then Visitors will have greater access to the content that you have placed on our Site. You have the option of opting-out of ""mini-searches."" You may also request to become a ""feature member"" in which your Content will be prominently displayed on our homepage. Please be aware that all Visitors will be able to view your Content if you opt-in to participate in: (i) the mini-searches, (ii) become a featured member; or (iii) activate an external profile.
3.7. Forums and Chat Rooms. As part of our Facilities, we offer forums and chat rooms on our Site. We make only your username available to other users of these Facilities. Any comments you contribute to the online dialogue, however, become public immediately, attributed to your username. You should, therefore, use discretion in what you submit to these exchanges. Additional guidelines for the use of our forums and chat rooms are available on our Site.
3.8. Surveys and Contests. Periodically, we may initiate surveys or contests at SwingLifeStyle.com, and we may request Personally Identifiable Information from you in connection with such surveys and contests. You are free to choose whether you participate in a survey or contest. The information we request may include contact information, and this information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and appeal of our Site. We will notify you of relevant details in connection with asking for your participation in such surveys or contests.
4. Your Responsibility for Member-Directed Information
Member-Directed Information is information you intend to provide or make available to other Members on our Site via our Facilities including, but not limited to, our forums and chat rooms as well the information that you include on your profile.

8. Additional Tools for Protecting Your Privacy
We recognize that users may provide more personal information than they intend, or should, over the public areas in social networking sites. We provide a range of features to assist our Members seeking to preserve an appropriate level of privacy, including the following:
8.1. Privacy Controls. We provide you with privacy controls, that allow you to: (i) designate your profile as ""offline,"" (ii) ""block"" certain Members; and (iii) designate certain uploaded visual content as ""public,"" ""private,"" or ""personal"" (collectively, our ""Privacy Controls""). You may, for example, request us to designate your Profile as ""offline."" Profiles designated as ""offline"" restrict the access that other Members have to your Profile. In addition, you have the ability to ""block"" specific Members. When posting photographs, video, and other visual content on our Site, you can designate the image as either public, private, or personal. All Members, and potentially Site Visitors, can view content marked ""public,"" and only those Members that you give permission to can view your uploaded content that is marked ""private"" or ""personal."" If you create an external profile, then Site Visitors may be able to view additional content in your profile.
We have implemented specific guidelines for the subject matter that can be depicted in the content that you upload onto the Website. In an effort to ensure Member compliance with our guidelines, DashBoardHosting has created procedures for reviewing and filtering content. Visual content that is designated as ""public"" is first reviewed by our Members in an attempt to ensure compliance with our guidelines and Terms. ""Public"" visual content is then reviewed by DashBoardHosting employees before it is posted on our Site. Visual content that is designated as ""private"" is only intended to be reviewed by DashBoardHosting before it is posted on our Site. Visual content that is designated as ""personal"" is intended to be reviewed by only Members before it is posted on our Site. DashBoardHosting may choose, but does not assume the obligation, to ""spot check"" personal visual content for compliance with our Terms and guidelines.

Please either employ the Privacy Controls, or choose carefully the information you post on your profile, and that you provide to other Members. You should take care if you choose to include information that personally identifies you, such as your telephone number, street address, last name, email address, and any photographs that could easily identify you or where you are located.

2. General information about data processing
a. Information on our authorizations
We process personal data within the legally permissible limits. This means that data processing operations are based on a legal basis. These are standardized in Art. 6 para. 1 DSGVO. Most data processing is based on a legitimate interest on our part (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO), on processing operations necessary for the performance of the contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO) or on the basis of consent given by you (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO). In the latter case, you will be informed separately (e.g. via a cookie banner) about the consent process.
Subject to this, personal data will only be passed on in the cases described below.
Personal data is only processed by us for unambiguous purposes (Art. 5 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO). As soon as the purpose of the processing ceases to apply, your personal data will be deleted or protected by technical as well as organizational measures (e.g. by pseudonymization).
The same applies to the expiry of a prescribed storage period, subject to cases in which further storage is necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract. In addition, there may be a legal obligation to store data for a longer period or to pass it on to third parties (esp. to law enforcement agencies). In other cases, the storage period and type of data collected as well as the type of data processing depends on which Poll Pay functions you use in the individual case. We will also be happy to provide you with information about this in individual cases, in accordance with Art. 15 DSGVO.
b. Information on the technical process of our app
Our App or the technical backEnd of our App (""Network"") is connected to various market research companies, marketplaces and businesses (collectively, ""Marketplaces""). These marketplaces regularly create surveys for their customers (companies). For these surveys, the Marketplaces seek participants to take the surveys. To help the marketplaces find participants, we built our app with Poll Pay services. We match the marketplaces looking for participants with the participants, which is you. You, as a user of the app, deposit personal data in your user account when you create a user account and when you use a user account. This personal data is also called ""qualifications"" in our app. This is because we need to filter whether you are eligible for each new survey for which participants are sought. Either we can find this out on the basis of the qualifications you have already deposited or we ask you again to complete some additional qualifications that you can deposit in your user account. If you are eligible for a survey based on a match between the qualifications requested by the marketplaces and the qualifications you have submitted, you will have the opportunity to participate. If you choose to participate, we will share the matching qualifications with the marketplace. The survey itself will take place either in our app itself or else on the marketplace website or the website of the market research firm or a company. A link in our app will connect you directly to the survey.
The privacy statements of the marketplaces can be viewed at the following links. The marketplaces are listed here under their publication name in the app, but not with their full name or company name.

With the user's permission, location data is shared with these partners so they can use it to deliver matching surveys or offers. Permission to share location can be withdrawn at any time in Poll Pay. The handling of the data and how the user's rights regarding the data can be viewed at the respective links.

3. Data processing in connection with the use of Poll Pay
The use of Poll Pay with all its functions requires the processing of certain personal data.
3.1 Informative use of the services of Poll Pay
The purely informational calling of Poll Pay requires the processing of the following personal data and information: operating system used, address of the terminal device with which you access Poll Pay (IP address) and the time of calling Poll Pay. All of this information is automatically transmitted from your App, should you not have configured it to suppress transmission of the information.
This personal data is processed for the purpose of the functionality and optimization of Poll Pay, as well as to ensure the security of our information technology systems. These purposes are at the same time legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO.
The storage period of your personal data is a maximum of 14 days. This personal data will not be merged with other data sources. A transfer of data to third parties will only take place in necessary cases. A transfer to third countries or international organizations does not take place, subject to further provisions of this privacy policy.
3.2 Use after registration with Poll Pay
Beyond the purely informational use of Poll Pay, you have the option to register for our Services and to use our entire offering.
This use of our Services requires processing of personal data and information in the manner set forth in this Section 3.
Some processing steps may also take place at third-party providers. The data processing of the third-party providers is carried out under the conditions of the respective relevant data protection declarations. In the case of data processing with third-party providers, this may be commissioned processing within the meaning of Art. 28 DSGVO. This is subject to strict legal requirements, which we comply with in the course of our contractual agreements with our processors.
The use after login and the associated data processing operations may differ from the purely informational use. The collection of this data, which is related to your profile, is carried out for the purpose of optimizing our services, for the purpose of ensuring the functionality of our offer (legitimate purposes according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) as well as for the fulfillment of our service obligations towards you (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO). If your consent is required for the processing operation, we will obtain it at the appropriate point (e.g. via the opt-in option in the context of a cookie banner when using our services for the first time). If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us within the scope of your right to information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) DSGVO.
3.3 Contact form / contacting us by e-mail
We process the data you provide to us when contacting us for the purpose of responding to your inquiry, your e-mail or your callback request. Processed data categories are master data, contact data, content data, possibly usage data, connection data and possibly contract data. We forward this data in individual cases to companies affiliated with us, i.e. only within our company/group. The legal basis of the processing depends on the purpose:
- Basically, it is based on our legitimate interest and thus on Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO;
- If a conclusion of a contract is to be targeted, the authorization is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO.
3.4 Creation and use of a user account
You can create a user account (hereinafter also referred to as ""profile"") in our Services in order to use the Poll Pay Services and your features. In order to do so, you must log in to one of our social media partners with one of your accounts. In doing so, our social media partners (Facebook, Instagram, Google, Apple, Twitter) will transmit personal data such as your email address to us and we will process it to create a user account and store it in our information technology systems. Your IP address and time of registration are also stored.
Other personal data that you can store independently in your user account or that you are asked for as part of the qualification query for a new survey include your age, your location, your gender and, if applicable, other personal characteristics (""qualifications"") required by the survey partners for joining a survey.
When you log into your profile, Poll Pay places cookies on your terminal device to enable you to remain logged in - even if you need to reload the app in the meantime. By creating the profile, they can use the functions of Poll Pay.
The processing operations associated with the creation and completion of a profile serve the purpose of being able to assign future usage operations and to be able to call up the entire range of Poll Pay services. Directly connected with this is, for example, checking whether you are suitable for surveys that we receive from the marketplaces. In order to participate in surveys, you must meet the criteria requested for the specific survey. We check whether you meet the criteria either by requesting you (if we have not yet requested the survey criteria from you), or automatically (if we have already requested the survey criteria from you) after receiving the survey by comparing the criteria with the personal information you have provided. The processing of your data thus serves the execution of the contract, is thus purpose-bound and necessary according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO.
The storage of IP address and time of registration is necessary to ensure the security of our information technology systems. This is also our legitimate interest, which is why the processing is also lawful according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
The personal data entered by you will be stored until the time of deletion of your profile at Poll Pay, and beyond that only as long as the processing is necessary for any contract performance.
A data transfer of your data to third parties is not intended. All checks on the requested criteria in a poll are carried out by us on our servers.
3.5 Processing of payment & provision of credits
Payment
To process the payout of credits you receive via participation in surveys in or via our app, we offer various payment methods, partly via payment service providers such as PayPal. Processed data in this context are usage data, connection data, master data, payment data, contact data or also contract data. The legal basis for the use of payment service providers results from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, as well as from our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO to enable a user-friendly and uncomplicated payment processing. Please note, however: Personal data may also be disclosed on the part of the online payment service provider to service providers, to subcontractors or other affiliated companies, insofar as this is necessary to fulfill the contractual obligations arising from your order or the personal data is to be processed on behalf of them. We have signed an order processing agreement with each of the payment service providers so that the security of the processing of your data is guaranteed at all times.
The recipient is the respective service provider, such as: PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A. A transfer of data to a third country may take place. The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. Furthermore, the data will be deleted if you revoke your consent or request the deletion of the personal data.
The payment service providers in detail are:
PayPal
It is possible to process the payment transaction with the online payment service PayPal. PayPal makes it possible to make online payments to third parties. The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449 Luxembourg. If you choose PayPal as a payment method, your data required for the payment process will be automatically transmitted to PayPal. This is regularly the following data:
Name, address, company, e-mail address, telephone and mobile number, IP address. The data transmitted to PayPal may be transmitted by PayPal to credit agencies. The purpose of this transmission is to check your identity and creditworthiness. PayPal may also pass on your data to third parties, insofar as this is necessary for the fulfillment of contractual obligations or the data is to be processed on behalf. You can read PayPal's privacy policy at https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full/. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, as the processing of the data is necessary for the payment with PayPal and thus for the performance of the contract.
If you make a payment with PayPal, please check that you are responsible for paying taxes according to the laws in your country/region.
Exchange for vouchers
You can also exchange your credits, which you receive by participating in surveys in or through our app, for vouchers from our partners, such as StarBucks, Amazon, Zalando, Google Play Store, iTunes, Spotify, etc. Should you choose to do so, we will not share any of your personal data with our partners. For the allocation of vouchers, our service providers Cadooz and Tango Card transmit a non-personal ID and a credit score without personal reference. For this credit balance, Cadooz and Tango Card then transmit a voucher in the form of voucher codes to us, which we in turn pass on to you. Cadooz and Tango Card thus act as an intermediary that handles the ordering and processing of the allocation of vouchers by redeeming credit codes as our service provider. Cadooz and Tango Card do not process any personal data about you. Once you have received voucher codes, you can use them, for example, when shopping on the aforementioned platforms or in the aforementioned stores.
Further information about Cadooz can be found at https://www.cadooz.com.

5. Data subject rights
If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of the DSGVO and as a user you are entitled to the following rights against the controller:
5.1 Right to information
You may request confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed by us.
If such processing exists, you may request information from the controller about the following:
- The purposes for which the personal data are processed;
- the categories of personal data which are processed;
- the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been or will be disclosed;
- the planned duration of the storage of the personal data concerning you or, if concrete information on this is not possible, criteria for determining the storage period;
- the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of the personal data concerning you, a right to restriction of processing by the controller or a right to object to such processing;
- the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;
- any available information on the origin of the data, if the personal data are not collected from the data subject;
- the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in these cases, meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.
- You have the right to request information about whether personal data concerning you is transferred to a third country or to an international organization. In this context, you may request to be informed about the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 DSGVO in connection with the transfer.
5.2 Right to rectification
You have a right to rectification and/or completion vis-à-vis the controller if the personal data processed concerning you are inaccurate or incomplete. The controller shall carry out the rectification without undue delay.
5.3 Right to restriction of processing
Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the processing of personal data concerning you:
- if you dispute the accuracy, of the personal data concerning you for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
- the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the personal data and request instead the restriction of the use of the personal data;
- the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you need them for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
- if you have objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) DSGVO, as long as it has not yet been determined whether the legitimate grounds of the controller outweigh your grounds.
- If the processing of personal data concerning you has been restricted, such data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or a Member State.
If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.
5.4 Right to erasure
5.4.1 You may request the controller to erase the personal data concerning you without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to erase this data without undue delay, if one of the following reasons applies:
- The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
- You withdraw your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a or Art. 9 (2) a DSGVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
- You object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the You object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) DSGVO.
- The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully.
- The erasure of the personal data concerning you is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
- The personal data concerning you has been collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Article 8(1) of the GDPR.
5.4.2 If the controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged to erase it pursuant to Article 17(1) of the GDPR, it shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, having regard to the available technology and the cost of implementation, to inform data controllers which process the personal data that you, as the data subject, have requested that they erase all links to or copies or replications of such personal data.
5.4.3 The right to erasure shall not apply to the extent that the processing is necessary
- For the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information;
- for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
- for reasons of public interest in the area of public health pursuant to Art. 9 (2) (h) and (i) and Art. 9 (3) DSGVO;
- for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 (1) DSGVO, insofar as the right referred to in (1) is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the achievement of the purposes of such processing; or
- for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.
5.5 Right to information
If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing against the controller, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
You have the right vis-à-vis the controller to be informed about these recipients.
5.6 Right to data portability
You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to the controller in a structured, common and machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom the personal data was provided, provided that
the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a DSGVO or Art. 9 (2) a DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b DSGVO and
the processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures.
In exercising this right, you also have the right to obtain that the personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one controller to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by this.
The right to data portability does not apply to processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
5.7 Right to object
You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
The controller shall no longer process the personal data concerning you unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to processing of the personal data concerning you for the purposes of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these purposes.
You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information society services - notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC - to exercise your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.
5.8 Right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law
You have the right to revoke your declaration of consent under data protection law at any time. The revocation of the consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
The processing is lawful until your revocation - the revocation thus only affects the processing after receipt of your revocation. You can declare the revocation informally by mail or e-mail. The processing of your personal data will then no longer take place, subject to permission by another legal basis. If this is not the case, your data must be deleted immediately after the revocation in accordance with Art. 17 (2) DSGVO. Your right to revoke your consent subject to the above conditions is guaranteed.
Your revocation should be addressed to:
BitBurst GmbH
Lerchenweg 3
40789 Monheim am Rhein, Germany
015256114159
[email protected]
www.bitburst.net
5.9 Right to complain to a supervisory authority
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your residence, workplace or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.
6. Automated decisions in individual cases including profiling.
Automated decisions in individual cases including profiling do not take place.
7. Newsletter
If you subscribe to our company's newsletter, the data in the respective input mask will be transmitted to the controller. The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registration, you will receive an e-mail in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with foreign e-mail addresses. When registering for the newsletter, the user's IP address and the date and time of registration are stored. This serves to prevent misuse of the services or the e-mail address of the person concerned. The data will not be passed on to unauthorized third parties. For the purpose of sending the newsletter, however, necessary data could be transmitted to appropriate service providers. Furthermore, an exception exists if there is a legal obligation to pass on the data. The data is used exclusively for sending the newsletter. The subscription to the newsletter can be cancelled by the data subject at any time. Likewise, consent to the storage of personal data can be revoked at any time. For this purpose, a corresponding link can be found in each newsletter. The legal basis for the processing of the data after registration for the newsletter by the user is, if the user has given his consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO. The legal basis for sending the newsletter as a result of the sale of goods or services is Section 7 (3) UWG.
8. Data transmission to third countries
The controller may transfer personal data to a third country. In principle, the controller can ensure that an adequate level of protection is brought about for the processing operations by means of various appropriate safeguards. It is possible to transfer data transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision, internal data protection rules, approved codes of conduct, standard data protection clauses or an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Art. 46(2)(a)-(f) GDPR.
If the controller makes a transfer to a third country on the legal basis of Art. 49 (1) a) DSGVO, you will be informed at this point about the possible risks of a data transfer to a third country.
There is a risk that the third country receiving your personal data may not provide an equivalent level of protection compared to the protection of personal data in the European Union. This may be the case, for example, if the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for the respective third country or if certain agreements between the European Union and the respective third country are declared invalid. Specifically, in some third countries there are risks regarding the effective protection of EU fundamental rights through the use of surveillance laws (for example, the USA). In such a case, it is the responsibility of the controller and the recipient to assess whether the rights of data subjects in the third country enjoy an equivalent level of protection as in the Union and can also be effectively enforced.
However, the General Data Protection Regulation should not undermine the level of protection afforded to individuals throughout the Union when personal data are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organizations, including when personal data are further transferred from a third country or from an international organization to controllers or processors in the same or another third country or to the same or another international organization.
9. Integration of other services and contents of third parties
Description and purpose
It may happen that third-party content, such as videos, fonts or graphics from other websites, is integrated within this online offer. This always requires that the providers of this content (hereinafter referred to as ""third-party providers"") are aware of the IP address of the user. This is because without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user. The IP address is thus necessary for the display of this content. We endeavor to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the content. However, we have no influence if the third-party providers store the IP address, e.g. for statistical purposes. Insofar as this is known to us, we inform the users about it. We would like to provide and improve our online offer through these integrations.
Legal basis
The legal basis for the integration of other third-party services and content is Art. 6 (1) lit. f) DSGVO. Our overriding legitimate interest lies in the intention of an appropriate presentation of our online presence and user-friendly and economically efficient services on our part. For further information, please refer to the respective data protection information of the providers.
Contractual or legal obligation for the provision of personal data
The provision of personal data is not required by law or contract, nor is it necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide the personal data. However, failure to provide it would possibly result in you not being able to use this function or not being able to use it to its full extent.
10. Notification obligations of the responsible party
If your personal data has been disclosed to other recipients (third parties) with legal grounds, we will notify them of any rectification, erasure or restriction of the processing of your personal data (Art. 16, Art. 17(1) and Art. 18 DSGVO). The notification obligation does not apply if it is associated with a disproportionate effort or is impossible. We will also inform you about the recipients upon request.",

How we protect and store your information
We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. In addition to two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps link to your accounts, we continue to work hard to ensure the security of your information. We deploy automated technology to detect abusive behavior and content that could harm you, other users, or the Services.
After you have signed up for a TeraBox account, we retain the information you store in the Services for as long as your account exists or as long as necessary to provide you with the Services. If you want to delete your account, please send an email to helpdesk@flextech.com with such a request and we will delete your account within 30 days after receiving your request. However, 1) we will not delete your account information until we have verified your user identity; 2) such deletion of information from our servers and backup storage may be delayed; 3) we may retain this information if necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or exercise our rights under the Contract.
We will store your personal information for the period required for providing the Services. However, in the event that laws and regulations require otherwise, you agree to keep the information for a longer term, it is necessary to ensure the security and quality of the Services, the information is required to settle disputes, or it is technically intractable to process the information as required, we will extend the retention period as per laws and agreement or to a reasonable extent after the expiration of the aforesaid period.
When the retention period expires, we will delete your personal information or de-identify it in accordance with laws and regulations.
We will collect, use, store, and transfer your information based on the principle of ""minimization"", and inform you of the purpose and scope of use of the information by means of user agreement, privacy policy, rules, pop-up notifications, notices, and so on.
We attach great importance to information security. We have a dedicated team to develop and employ a variety of security technologies and programs. We carry out security background checks on personnel in charge of security management and those in critical security positions. We have established a complete information security management system and internal mechanisms for handling security events and more. We take appropriate security measures and technical means in line with industry standards to store and protect your personal information, so as to prevent your information from being lost or accessed, disclosed, used, damaged, or revealed without authorization. All reasonable and feasible measures are being taken for protecting your personal information. In addition, we use encryption technology to ensure the confidentiality of data and apply trusted protection mechanisms to prevent malicious attacks on data.
We train and assess our employees in terms of data security awareness and security abilities to enhance their comprehension of the importance of protecting personal information. We authenticate the identity of employees who process personal information and control their access, sign nondisclosure agreements with our employees and partners who have access to your personal information, and clarify job responsibilities and code of conduct, so that only authorized personnel can access personal information. In the event of any violation of the nondisclosure agreements, the employment will be terminated immediately with the violator held accountable by law. Moreover, there are also confidentiality requirements that relevant personnel must follow when they leave their posts.
We kindly remind you that the Internet is not absolutely secure. Hence, you should carefully protect your personal information when you interact with other users through third-party social software, emails, SMS, and other services integrated into TeraBox under the condition that you are uncertain whether your information is completely encrypted during transfer.
Also, we appreciate your understanding that due to the technical restrictions, rapid development, and various latent and malicious attacks pertaining to the Internet industry, we may not be able to keep your information secure a hundred percent even though we make every effort to enhance our security measures. Hence, the system and communication network based on which you use our product and/or the Services may encounter security problems in other processes beyond our control.
Our security management system regards the disclosure, damage, or loss of personal information as the most serious security event. Once it occurs, our highest-level emergency plan will be implemented with multiple departments dealing with the event as one emergency response team.
We formulate an emergency plan for network security events to promptly respond to system vulnerabilities, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, network intrusions, and other security risks. In case of an event endangering network security, we will immediately carry out the plan, take remedial actions, and report to competent authorities as required.
The disclosure, damage, and loss of personal information are regarded as the most serious security events. Accordingly, we organize members of working groups to perform security plan drills on a regular basis to avoid such events. In the event that such events do occur, we will carry out the emergency plan as a top priority and form an emergency response team to trace the cause and mitigate losses in the shortest time possible.
In case of a personal information security event, we will, as required by laws and regulations, inform you of the basic information about the security event and its possible impact, the measures we have taken or will take, recommendations on actively preventing and mitigating risks for you, and remedial measures for you. We will inform you of event-related information in a timely manner through our notifications or the contact information you have provided to us including SMS, phone number, and email address. If it is difficult to inform our users one by one, we will make announcements in a reasonable and effective way. Meanwhile, we will report the disposal of the personal information security event in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities. We appreciate your understanding that according to laws and regulations, if measures taken by us can effectively avoid the harm caused by disclosure, tampering, and loss of information, we may choose not to notify you of a personal information security event unless a regulatory authority requires us to do so.
We refer to the requirements of the GDPR, select appropriate measures for technical security protection based on the nature, scope, background, and purpose of data processing, as well as the risks to individuals, and regularly test and evaluate the measures to maintain their effectiveness.
If data is accidentally disclosed, we will notify affected people as soon as possible and report to competent authorities within 72 hours. If it is impossible to report it within 72 hours, the reason for the delay will be clarified.
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to achieve our data protection objectives, such as the principle of data minimization and the integration of necessary safeguards into data processing to protect the rights of data subjects and make sure any data processed is necessary for a specific purpose by default.

1. Что регулирует настоящая политика конфиденциальности Настоящая политика конфиденциальности (далее — Политика) действует в отношении всей информации, включая персональные данные в понимании применимого законодательства (далее — «Персональная информация»), которую ООО «ЯНДЕКС» и/или его аффилированные лица, в том числе входящие в одну группу с ООО «ЯНДЕКС» (далее — «Яндекс»), могут получить о Вас в процессе использования Вами любых сайтов, программ, продуктов и/или сервисов Яндекса (далее вместе — «Сервисы»), информацию о которых Вы можете найти на сайтах yandex.ru, yandex.com, yandex.by, yandex.kz, yandex.com.tr, yandex.co.il и других принадлежащих Яндексу сайтах (далее вместе — «Сайты»), а также в ходе исполнения Яндексом / его аффилированными лицами любых соглашений и договоров, заключенных с Вами в связи с использованием Вами Сервисов. Яндекс может также получать Персональную информацию от своих партнеров (далее — «Партнеры»), сайты, программы, продукты или сервисы которых Вы используете (например, от рекламодателей Яндекса или служб такси), из других источников с общедоступными персональными данными. В соответствующих случаях передача Персональной информации возможна только в случаях, установленных применимым законодательством, и осуществляется на основании специальных договоров между Яндексом и каждым из Партнеров. Пожалуйста, обратите внимание, что использование любого из Сайтов и/или Сервисов может регулироваться дополнительными условиями, которые могут вносить в настоящую Политику изменения и/или дополнения, и/или иметь специальные условия в отношении персональной информации, размещенные в соответствующих разделах документов для таких Сайтов /или Сервисов.

3. Какова цель данной Политики Защита Вашей Персональной информации и Вашей конфиденциальности чрезвычайно важны для Яндекса. Поэтому при использовании Вами Сайтов и Сервисов Яндекс защищает и обрабатывает Вашу Персональную информацию в строгом соответствии с применимым законодательством. Следуя нашим обязанностям защищать Вашу Персональную информацию, в этой Политике мы хотели бы наиболее прозрачно проинформировать Вас о следующих моментах: (a) зачем и как Яндекс собирает и использует («обрабатывает») Вашу Персональную информацию, когда Вы используете Сайты и/или Сервисы; (b) какова роль и обязанности Яндекса как юридического лица, принимающего решение о том, зачем и как обрабатывать Вашу Персональную информацию; (c) какие инструменты Вы можете использовать для сокращения объема собираемой Яндексом Персональной информации о Вас; (d) каковы Ваши права в рамках проводимой обработки Персональной информации.
4. Какую Персональную информацию о Вас собирает Яндекс Персональная информация, собранная в процессе работы Сайтов и/или предоставления Сервисов, а также в процессе использования сайтов, программ, продуктов или сервисов Партнеров, может различаться в зависимости от того, используете Вы для доступа к ним Вашу учетную запись или нет. В тех случаях, когда Вы осуществляете вход в свою учетную запись, Персональная информация, собранная о Вас Яндексом во время использования Вами Сайтов и Сервисов, может быть сопоставлена и связана с другой Персональной информацией, собранной Яндексом в рамках использования Вами Вашей учетной записи (например, данные о Вашей личности, контактные данные, возраст и пол, если они были предоставлены Яндексу). Яндекс не проверяет предоставленную Вами Персональную информацию за исключением случаев, предусмотренных пользовательским соглашением или условиями использования отдельных Сервисов, и не может судить о ее достоверности, а также о том, обладаете ли вы достаточной правоспособностью для предоставления Вашей Персональной информации. Тем не менее Яндекс исходит из того, что Вы предоставляете достоверную и достаточную Персональную информацию, а также своевременно обновляете ее. Яндекс может собирать следующие категории Персональной информации о Вас во время использования Вами Сайтов и Сервисов: (i) Персональная информация, предоставленная Вами при регистрации (создании учетной записи), такая как Ваше имя, номер телефона, адрес и возраст; (ii) электронные данные (HTTP-заголовки, IP-адрес, файлы cookie, веб-маяки/пиксельные теги, данные об идентификаторе браузера, информация об аппаратном и программном обеспечении, данные сети wi-fi); (iii) дата и время осуществления доступа к Сайтам и/или Сервисам; (iv) информация о Вашей активности во время использования Сайтов и/или Сервисов (например, история поисковых запросов, данные о покупках в Сервисах, данные о посещенных организациях, лайки и предпочтения, адреса электронной почты тех, с кем Вы ведете переписку, данные телефонной книги, информация о взаимодействии с другими пользователями, а также файлы и контент, хранящиеся в системах Яндекса); (v) информация о геолокации; (vi) иная информация о Вас, необходимая для обработки в соответствии с условиями, регулирующими использование конкретных Сайтов или Сервисов Яндекса; (vii) информация о Вас, которую мы получаем от наших Партнеров в соответствии с условиями соглашений, заключенных между Вами и соответствующим Партнером, и соглашений, заключенных между Яндексом и Партнером; (viii) данные Ваших платежных карт, иная платежная информация, предоставленная Вами, а также полученная от Партнеров или иных лиц, участвующих в проведении платежной операции с использованием Сайтов или Сервисов Яндекса и/или в связи с оказанием Яндексом платных услуг. Также Яндекс использует файлы cookie и веб-маяки (включая пиксельные теги) для сбора Персональной информации и связывания такой личной информации с Вашим устройством и веб-браузером (см. раздел 11 настоящей Политики). Яндекс не собирает целенаправленно чувствительную персональную информацию (такую как расовое происхождение, политические взгляды, информация о здоровье и биометрические данные), за исключением случаев, предусмотренных пользовательскими соглашениями отдельных Сервисов. Тем не менее Вы можете самостоятельно предоставить их Яндексу, и в таком случае Яндекс будет обрабатывать их в рамках предоставления Вам Сервисов (например, если Вы задаете поисковые запросы, относящиеся к Вашему здоровью). При этом Вы должны принимать во внимание, что Яндекс не может запросить Ваше согласие на такую обработку, поскольку не осведомлен заранее о потенциально чувствительном характере Персональной информации, которую Вы можете предоставить Яндексу. Яндекс не собирает данные с целью составления «портрета» пользователя в той степени, при которой это может существенно повлиять на Ваши права и свободы в соответствии с применимым законодательством.
5. Какова правовая основа и цели обработки Вашей Персональной информации Яндекс не вправе обрабатывать Вашу Персональную информацию без достаточных на то правовых оснований. Поэтому Яндекс обрабатывает Вашу Персональную информацию только в том случае, если: (i) обработка необходима для выполнения договоров между Вами и Яндексом, таких как Пользовательское соглашение сервисов Яндекса (https://yandex.ru/legal/rules) и условия предоставления отдельных Сервисов Яндекса, что также включает обеспечение работы Сайтов и Сервисов (например, предоставление Вам результатов поиска по Вашим поисковым запросам); (ii) обработка необходима для соблюдения установленных законодательством обязательств; (iii) когда это предусмотрено применимым законодательством, обработка необходима для обеспечения законных интересов Яндекса в случае, если такая обработка не оказывает существенного влияния на Ваши интересы, Ваши фундаментальные права и свободы. Обратите внимание, что при обработке Вашей персональной информации на указанном основании, Яндекс всегда будет стремиться поддерживать баланс между своими законными интересами и защитой Вашей конфиденциальности. Яндекс обрабатывает Вашу Персональную информацию для обеспечения своих законных интересов, например, в следующих случаях: (a) чтобы лучше понимать, как Вы взаимодействуете с нашими Сайтами и/или Сервисами; (b) чтобы совершенствовать, менять, персонализировать или иным образом улучшать Сайты и Сервисы в интересах всех пользователей; (c) чтобы предлагать Вам другие продукты и сервисы Яндекса или других компаний, которые, по нашему мнению, могут Вас заинтересовать (т. е. показывать Вам рекламу, учитывающую Ваши интересы); (iv) для конкретных целей либо в соответствии с требованием применимого законодательства мы можем запросить Ваше отдельное согласие на обработку Вашей Персональной информации. Для юрисдикций, где согласие признается отдельным правовым основанием, начало использования вами Сайтов и/или Сервисов Яндекс выражает Ваше согласие с такой обработкой. Настоящим мы информируем Вас, а Вы подтверждаете, что у Вас нет никаких обязательств по предоставлению нам какой-либо Персональной информации при использовании Вами Сайтов или Услуг, и такое предоставление основано исключительно на Вашей свободной воле. Вместе с тем Вы осознаете, что без предоставления Персональной информации мы не сможем предоставить Вам возможность воспользоваться Сервисами, а использование Вами Сайтов будет ограничено. Яндекс всегда обрабатывает Вашу Персональную информацию в определенных целях и только ту Персональную информацию, которая имеет отношение к достижению таких целей. В частности, мы обрабатываем Вашу Персональную информацию для следующих целей: (i) предоставление Вам доступа к Сайтам и/или Сервисам (в т. ч. предоставление результатов поиска в ответ на Ваши поисковые запросы с учетом Ваших предпочтений, истории поиска и другой Персональной информации о Вас, доступной Яндексу); (ii) предоставление доступа к Вашей учетной записи, включая электронный почтовый ящик Яндекса и хранилище файлов, если Вы зарегистрированы в соответствующих Сервисах; (iii) осуществление связи с Вами для направления Вам уведомлений, запросов и информации, относящейся к работе Сайтов и Сервисов, выполнения соглашений с Вами и обработки Ваших запросов и заявок; (iv) персонализация рекламы и предложений с учетом Ваших предпочтений, истории поиска и другой Персональной информации о Вас, доступной Яндексу; (v) повышение удобства использования Сайтов и Сервисов, в том числе для показа наиболее релевантных результатов поиска и предоставления более персонализированных Сайтов и Сервисов, а также для улучшения других продуктов, приложений и Сервисов Яндекса; (vi) создание новых продуктов, утилит и предложений Яндекса; (vii) защита Ваших прав и прав Яндекса; (viii) сбор, обработка и представление статистических данных, больших данных и других исследований; (ix) выявление угроз безопасности для Сайтов и Сервисов, пользователей, Яндекса и/или третьих лиц, в том числе проверка Вашей благонадежности при заключении договоров с использованием Сайтов и Сервисов; (x) организация приема Ваших платежей, осуществления Вами оплаты товаров и услуг с использованием Сайтов и Сервисов. Использование в Сервисах Яндекса информации, полученной от API Google (далее – «Полученные данные»), осуществляется в соответствие с положениями Google API Disclosure с учетом указанных в ней ограничений, а именно: Полученные данные используются исключительно для целей предоставления Вам функций почтового клиента. Полученные данные не могут быть использованы для передачи третьим лицам, для показа рекламных материалов и иных целей, связанных с неправомерным доступом к содержанию Вашей переписки. Подробнее с условиями обработки Полученных данных Вы можете ознакомиться по адресу: (https://yandex.ru/legal/confidential_google_api).
6. Как Яндекс защищает Вашу Персональную информацию В большинстве случаев Персональная информация обрабатывается автоматически без доступа к ней кого-либо из сотрудников Яндекса. В случае если такой доступ понадобится, то он может быть предоставлен только тем сотрудникам Яндекса, которые нуждаются в этом для выполнения своих задач. Для защиты и обеспечения конфиденциальности данных все сотрудники должны соблюдать внутренние правила и процедуры в отношении обработки Персональной информации. Они также должны следовать всем техническим и организационным мерам безопасности, действующим для защиты Вашей Персональной информации. Яндекс также внедрил достаточные технические и организационные меры для защиты Персональной информации от несанкционированного, случайного или незаконного уничтожения, потери, изменения, недобросовестного использования, раскрытия или доступа, а также иных незаконных форм обработки. Данные меры безопасности были реализованы с учетом современного уровня техники, стоимости их реализации, рисков, связанных с обработкой и характером Персональной информации.
7. Кто еще имеет доступ к Вашей Персональной информации и кому она может быть передана 7.1 В рамках Группы Яндекса Яндекс может передавать Вашу Персональную информацию своим сотрудникам (в пределах, указанных в разделе 6 настоящей Политики). Яндекс также может передавать Вашу Персональную информацию своим аффилированным лицам, в том числе другим компаниям из группы лиц, к которой принадлежит Яндекс («Группа Яндекса»). Обратите внимание, что уровень защиты Персональной информации в некоторых странах может не совпадать с уровнем, установленным в вашей юрисдикции, и, используя Сервисы Яндекса, Вы соглашаетесь на такую передачу. Если иное не установлено условиями использования Сайтов и/или Сервисов, предоставляемых компаниями Группы Яндекса, во всех случаях Персональная информация будет обрабатываться только для целей, изложенных в разделе 5 настоящей Политики. Ваша Персональная информация может передаваться в том числе лицам, указанным на странице: https://yandex.ru/legal/affiliates. 7.2 Вне Группы Яндекса Яндекс также может передавать Персональную информацию третьим лицам, не входящим в Группу Яндекса, для достижения целей, указанных в разделе 5 настоящей Политики. Обратите внимание, что уровень защиты Персональной информации в некоторых странах может не совпадать с уровнем, установленном в вашей юрисдикции, и, используя Сервисы Яндекса, Вы соглашаетесь на такую передачу. К таким третьим лицам могут относиться: (i) Партнеры, такие как владельцы сайтов и приложений, рекламные сети и другие партнеры, предоставляющие Яндексу услуги, связанные с размещением и отображением рекламы на сайтах, в программах, продуктах или сервисах, которые принадлежат таким партнерам или контролируются ими; компании, предоставляющие услуги перевозки (такси); (ii) рекламодатели или другие Партнеры, которые отображают для Вас рекламу на Сайтах и/или на Сервисах Яндекса, а также такие Партнеры как поставщики информационных сервисов или консультанты; (iii) лица, предоставляющие информацию для выявления угроз безопасности для Сайтов и Сервисов, пользователей, Яндекса и/или третьих лиц, в том числе при проверке Вашей благонадежности при заключении договоров с использованием Сайтов и Сервисов; (iv) лица, участвующие в организации приема Ваших платежей и проведении платежных операций с использованием Сайтов и Сервисов (международные платежные системы, поставщики платежных инструментов, банки и иные финансовые организации и т.д.). Яндекс также может передавать Персональную информацию третьим лицам, не входящим в Группу Яндекса: (i) третьим лицам, которым произведена уступка прав или обязанностей по договорам, связанным с предоставлением пользователям Сервисов, или которые осуществляют контроль иным образом над лицами, предоставляющими Сервисы, в результате их приобретения (посредством приобретения юридических лиц, объектов интеллектуальной собственности, имущества, имущественных прав и иным образом); (ii) любому национальному и/или международному регулирующему органу, правоохранительным органам, центральным или местным исполнительным органам власти, другим официальным или государственным органам или судам, в отношении которых Яндекс обязан предоставлять информацию в соответствии с применимым законодательством по соответствующему запросу; (iii) третьим лицам, в случае если Вы выразили согласие на передачу Вашей Персональной информации либо передача Персональной информации требуется для предоставления Вам соответствующего Сервиса или выполнения определенного соглашения или договора, заключенного с Вами; (iv) любому третьему лицу в целях обеспечения правовой защиты Яндекса или третьих лиц при нарушении Вами Пользовательского соглашения сервисов Яндекса (https://yandex.ru/legal/rules), настоящей Политики или условий, регулирующих использование отдельных Сервисов, либо в ситуации, когда существует угроза такого нарушения.
8. Где хранится и обрабатывается Ваша Персональная информация Ваша Персональная информация будет храниться в Российской Федерации и/или в ЕЭЗ. Для российских пользователей: Яндекс осуществляет запись, систематизацию, накопление, хранение, уточнение (обновление, изменение), извлечение персональных данных граждан Российской Федерации с использованием баз данных, находящихся на территории Российской Федерации. Для пользователей из ЕЭЗ, Швейцарии или Израиля: Россия является юрисдикцией за пределами Европейской экономической зоны, которая не была признана Европейской комиссией как обеспечивающая адекватный уровень защиты персональных данных. Поэтому Яндекс принял соответствующие меры для обеспечения того, чтобы такая передача осуществлялась в соответствии с действующими правилами защиты данных ЕС. В частности, Яндекс руководствуется Стандартными договорными условиями, утвержденными Европейской комиссией, для обеспечения адекватного уровня защиты Вашей Персональной информации, передаваемой в Россию. Копию этих Стандартных договорных условий можно получить по запросу. Если Вы находитесь на территории, где для передачи Вашей Личной информации в другую юрисдикцию требуется Ваше согласие, то используя Сайты или Сервисы, Вы даете Яндексу свое явное и однозначное согласие на такую передачу или хранение, и/или обработку информации в других указанных юрисдикциях, включая Россию.
9. Как долго мы храним Вашу Персональную информацию Яндекс будет хранить Вашу Персональную информацию столько времени, сколько это необходимо для достижения цели, для которой она была собрана, или для соблюдения требований законодательства и нормативных актов. Если иное не требуется по закону или соглашению с Вами, электронные письма и документы, которые Вы храните в системах Яндекса как часть Сервиса, будут храниться до тех пор, пока у Вас есть учетная запись, но они могут быть удалены Вами в любое время. Если Вы хотите, чтобы какая-либо Ваша Персональная информация была удалена из баз данных Яндекса, Вы можете самостоятельно удалить необходимую Персональную информацию через интерфейс Сайтов и/или Сервисов (где это применимо). Инструмент управления данными доступен для авторизованных в сервисах Яндекса пользователей в специальном разделе «Управление данными» на странице профиля в Яндекс ID (https://passport.yandex.ru/profile ).
10. Ваши права 10.1 Какими правами Вы обладаете В случае если это предусмотрено применимым законодательством, Вы имеете право на доступ к Вашей Персональной информации, обрабатываемой Яндексом в соответствии с настоящей Политикой. Если Вы считаете, что какая-либо информация, которую Яндекс хранит о Вас, некорректная или неполная, Вы можете войти в свою учетную запись и исправить Вашу Персональную информацию самостоятельно. Если это предусмотрено применимым законодательством, Вы имеете право: ознакомиться с информацией, которую Яндекс хранит о Вас, в том числе посредством Вашей учетной записи на странице: https://yandex.ru/support/id/data.html , а также сохранить архив с Вашей Персональной информацией на своем устройстве;
требовать удаления Вашей Персональной информации или ее части, а также отзывать согласие на обработку Вашей персональной информации;
требовать ограничений на обработку Вашей Персональной информации;
запросить копию Стандартных договорных условий, разрешающих передачу Вашей Персональной информации в Россию и указанных в разделе 8 настоящей Политики;
возражать против обработки Вашей Персональной информации, если это предусмотрено применимым законодательством. Яндекс будет выполнять указанные запросы в соответствии с применимым законодательством. В случаях, предусмотренных применимым законодательством, Вы можете также обладать другими правами, не указанными выше. При использовании Вами Сервисов передача Персональной информации осуществляется c Вашего согласия, выражающего свободную волю и Ваш интерес, (в частности, на основании договора с Вами) и не является обязанностью по закону. 10.2 Как Вы можете реализовать свои права Для осуществления вышеуказанных прав, пожалуйста, войдите в свою учетную запись, а в случае отсутствия специальной функции в интерфейсе свяжитесь с Яндексом (см. раздел 13 настоящей Политики). Если Вы не удовлетворены тем, как Яндекс обрабатывает Вашу Персональную информацию, пожалуйста, сообщите нам, и мы рассмотрим Вашу претензию. Если Вы не удовлетворены ответом Яндекса, Вы имеете право подать жалобу в компетентный орган.
11. Как мы используем файлы cookie и другие подобные технологии на Сайтах или при использовании Вами Сервисов 11.1 Какие файлы cookie и зачем их использует Яндекс Файлы cookie — это небольшой фрагмент данных, который принимается и обрабатывается устройством, которое Вы используете для доступа к Сайтам. Файлы cookie хранят и отправляют обратно на Сайты информацию, которая помогает Вашей работе с Сайтами и позволяет нам запоминать Ваши предпочтения по истечении времени, например, настройки браузера или узнавать Вашу учетную запись. Для получения дополнительной информации о файлах cookie, их описании, о целях использования и возможных способах управления ими, следуйте нашей Политике использования файлов cookie. [https://yandex.ru/legal/cookies_policy]. На Сайтах используются следующие типы файлов cookie: строго необходимые файлы cookie / технические файлы cookie: эти файлы cookie необходимы для работы Сайтов и предоставления Вам Сервисов; кроме всего прочего, они позволяют Яндексу идентифицировать Ваше аппаратное и программное обеспечение, включая тип Вашего браузера;
статистические / аналитические файлы cookie: эти файлы cookie позволяют распознавать пользователей, подсчитывать их количество и собирать информацию, такую как произведенные Вами операции на Сайтах и в Сервисах, включая информацию о посещенных Вами веб-страницах и контенте, который Вы получаете;
технические файлы cookie: эти файлы cookie собирают информацию о том, как пользователи взаимодействуют с Сайтами и/или Сервисами, что позволяет выявлять ошибки и тестировать новые функции для повышения производительности Сайтов и Сервисов;
функциональные файлы cookie: эти файлы cookie позволяют предоставлять определенные функции, чтобы облегчить использование Вами Сайтов, например, сохраняя Ваши предпочтения (такие как язык и местоположение);
(сторонние) файлы отслеживания / рекламные файлы cookie: эти файлы cookie собирают информацию о пользователях, источниках трафика, посещенных страницах и рекламе, отображенной для Вас, а также той, по которой Вы перешли на рекламируемую страницу. Они позволяют отображать рекламу, которая может Вас заинтересовать, на основе анализа Персональной информации, собранной о Вас. Они также используются в статистических и исследовательских целях. На Сайтах используются следующие типы файлов cookie: 11.2 Как долго файлы cookie хранятся на Вашем устройстве Яндекс использует информацию, содержащуюся в файлах cookie только в указанных выше целях, после чего собранные данные будут храниться на Вашем устройстве в течение периода, который может зависеть от соответствующего типа файлов cookie, но не превышая срока, необходимого для достижения их цели, после чего они будут автоматически удалены из Вашей системы. 11.3 Кто еще имеет доступ к информации, содержащейся в файлах cookie Персональная информация, собранная с помощью файлов cookie, размещенных на Вашем устройстве, может быть передана и доступна Яндексу и/или третьим лицам, указанным в разделе 7 настоящей Политики. Использование Персональной информации вне Сайтов в рекламных целях, если таковые имеются, может быть предметом отдельных пользовательских соглашений, доступных на веб-сайтах третьих лиц. Яндекс и/или третьи лица могут также предоставить Вам возможность отказаться от персонализации рекламы, которая может быть предметом регулирования законодательства и правил, применимых к таким продуктам и предложениям. Вы также можете изменить настройки отображения персонализированной рекламы или отключить такую рекламу, воспользовавшись функционалом, размещенным по адресу: https://yandex.ru/tune/adv. При первом посещении Сайтов может быть запрошено Ваше согласие на использование файлов cookie. Если после того, как Вы одобрили использование файлов cookie, Вы захотите изменить свое решение, Вы сможете сделать это, удалив файлы cookie, хранящиеся в Вашем браузере (обычно это можно сделать в настройках браузера — пожалуйста, обратитесь к руководству по работе с браузером или сайту его разработчика). После этого может быть снова отображено всплывающее окно, запрашивающее Ваше согласие, и Вы сможете сделать иной выбор. Если Вы отказываетесь от использования файлов cookie, это может привести к тому, что некоторые функции Сайтов будут Вам недоступны, и повлияет на возможность использования Вами Cайтов. Вы также можете изменить настройки Вашего браузера, чтобы принимать или отклонять по умолчанию все файлы cookie или файлы cookie с определенных сайтов, включая Сайты Яндекса. Если Вы одобрили использование файлов cookie на одном из Сайтов Яндекса, мы будем считать, что использование файлов cookie на всех Cайтах было одобрено Вами. Яндекс также может использовать веб-маяки (пиксельные теги) для доступа к файлам cookie, ранее размещенным на Вашем устройстве, для следующих целей: (i) определение Ваших действий на Сайтах и в процессе использования Сервисов путем доступа и использования файлов cookie, хранящихся на Вашем устройстве; (ii) сбор статистической информации, связанной с работой Сайтов, Сервисов или продуктов, утилит и предложений Яндекса.

Яндекс имеет право вносить изменения по своему усмотрению, в том числе, но не ограничиваясь, в случаях, когда соответствующие изменения связаны с изменениями в применимом законодательстве, а также когда соответствующие изменения связаны с изменениями в работе Сайтов и Сервисов. Яндекс обязуется не вносить существенных изменений, не налагать дополнительных обременений или ограничений Ваших прав, установленных настоящей Политикой без Вашего уведомления. Вы будете уведомлены о таких изменениях. Соответствующие уведомления могут быть отображены на Сайте или в Сервисах (например, через всплывающее окно или баннер) до того, как такие изменения вступят в силу, или могут быть отправлены Вам по другим каналам связи (например, по электронной почте, если Вы предоставили нам Ваши контактные данные).

In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place all legally required physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you. We will ensure that we safeguard your personal information in accordance with applicable law.
For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification program for better security. When you send or receive data from your Xiaomi device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) and other algorithms.
All your personal information is stored on secure servers and protected in controlled facilities. We classify your information based on importance and sensitivity and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security. We have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.
We conduct due diligence on business partners and third party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information. We also check that appropriate security standards are maintained by these third parties by putting in place appropriate contractual restrictions, and where necessary, carrying out audits and assessments. In addition, our employees and those of our business partners and third party service providers who access your personal information are subject to enforceable contractual obligations of confidentiality.
We conduct security and privacy protection training courses and tests to enhance our employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information. We will take all practicable and legally required steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information when transferred from you or to you via the Internet.

Whenever you sign in as a Mi Account user on Xiaomi websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always sign out at the end of your session.
Xiaomi cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by a third party accessing your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.

Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

2.1.3 Compliance with the third principle, namely to minimize data and limit the purposes and period of storage by the Data Controller, is ensured by collecting only those data that are absolutely necessary for the purposes and activities of the Data Controller and its compliance with the legal requirements, as they are processed only for specific, explicitly stated and legitimate purposes, and are not processed in a way incompatible with these purposes, and are stored for a period not longer than necessary or provided by the law.

15.6 In addition to the above, we comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act (“the Eraser Law”) as far as it is applicable to our Service. This law provides additional protections to individuals under the age of 18 in California, including a right to be forgotten, which enable minors to remove their own posts (but not republications of their posts or posts about them by others). The Eraser Law also prohibits companies who operate websites or online services directed at minors from using the minor’s personal information to market or advertise certain enumerated products and services deemed potentially harmful for them.
15.7 Data Breach Notification under Cal. Civ. Code §§1798.29, 1798.82 and 1798.84.

Our Services collect some data automatically when you use the Services. We may obtain information by automated means, such as through browser cookies, pixels, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. Among other purposes, these technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services, (3) tailor the Services around your preferences, (4) manage and measure the usability of the Services, (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications, and (6) otherwise enhance the Services.
Information we may collect automatically includes information about:• your device, including MAC address, IP address, log information, hardware information, IMEI number, serial number, subscription information, device settings, connections to other devices, mobile network operator, web browser characteristics, app usage information, sales code, access code, current software version, subscription information, and randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifiers, such as Personalized Service ID (or PSID), and advertising IDs, including Google Ad ID;• your use of the Services, including clickstream data, your interactions with the Services (such as the web pages you visit, search terms, and the apps, services and features you use, download, or purchase), the pages that led or refer you to the Services, how you use the Services, and dates and times of use of the Services; and• your use of third-party websites, apps and features that are connected to certain Services.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. The Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from all of the features of our Services.
In addition to the categories of information obtained by Samsung discussed above, our Services may generate data automatically when you use certain Services (e.g. Samsung’s face-clustering technology that allows the device to group together images of the same face from different photographs (“Face-Clustering Data”)), or may utilize data that you generate independently (e.g. registering biometric data such as fingerprints to unlock your device or verify you in certain Services, or when you register your wake-up command in our Bixby Voice service). All of this data remains on the device and is not transmitted to Samsung, nor does Samsung obtain or access this data. Samsung does not share this data with third parties. Face-Clustering Data will remain on your device until you clear the cache in your system settings, you reset your device to its factory setting, or you delete the photos from your device. You can delete your registered biometric data or your wake-up command from your device at any time in the applicable settings. Because Samsung does not have access to this data, Samsung cannot delete it.
Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics.

Samsung Ads may deliver customized ads based on your demographic characteristics, preferences, choices, and interests by collecting certain information about your online activities as specified in this Privacy Policy. Please see the Samsung Ads Privacy Notice https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads for more information, including information on how to opt out of receiving customized ads from Samsung Ads.
Because Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests, and browsing context. These networks can track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information the ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

All of the activity falls within the bounds of the Google Analytics Terms of Service and Fabric Terms of Service.
Trial period and per-device licenses
Solid Explorer File Manager allows you to use all of its features for 2 weeks for free. In order to check and validate your trial period, the application needs to generate a unique identifier of your device. On devices prior to Android Oreo or when requesting per-device license, the identifier is an MD5 hash of the IMEI number or MAC address. The hash is unreversible, which means it’s impossible decode the original information.
For trial checks on devices running on Android Oreo and later, we use the ANDROID_ID property, which is automatically generated by your device and persisted across application reinstalls and data wipes. IMEI hash is still required for per-device licenses.
The hash is used to identify your device, when:
checking if your trial period is still valid
assigning per-device license
assigning bonus items to your device, such as plugins or color schemes
Per-device license case does not apply to you if you purchased the license via Google Play Store.
Targeted Advertising
Solid Explorer Classic uses Admob to display banner ads. In order to deliver, target and improve our advertising we use advertising ID. This helps us to show better ads that match your interests.

14.1.2 Right to rectification: you shall have the right to obtain from the Data Controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data concerning you – right to have incomplete Personal Data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
14.1.3 Right to erasure (“to be forgotten”): you have the right to request the Data Controller to delete without undue delay the Personal Data that concern you, when they are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected and/ or processed; when you withdraw your consent, on which their processing is based and there is no other legal basis for it; when you object to their Processing for the purposes of direct marketing and there are no legitimate grounds for processing to take precedence; when your Personal Data is processed in violation of the principles outlined above; when it must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation for the Data Controller or the Personal Data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services. This right shall not apply to the extent that Processing is necessary: (a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; (b) for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller; (c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; (d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in so far as the right is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that Processing; or (e) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

14.1.6 Right of objection: If you have consented to the Processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to this Processing at any time, including when it involves profiling. In any such case, the Processing of your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing is suspended.
14.1.7 In addition you have the right not to be the subject of a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has legal consequences for you and affects you significantly. In case you exercise this right, the Data Controller is obliged to apply appropriate measures to protect your rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests, ensuring human intervention and giving you the right to express your point of view and challenge its decision.
14.2 As a Data Subject, you may exercise the rights above by submitting a written application to the Data Controller.

Where requests from a Data Subject are manifestly unreasonable or excessive, in particular because of their recurrence, the Data Controller may: (i) charge a fee commensurate with the administrative costs of providing the information or correspondence, or of acting on the request, or (ii) refuse to act on the request. Each time the Data Controller refuses to accept an application submitted by you for the exercise of the rights above, you will receive a written refusal, as well as the reasons for it.

In some cases the communication shall not be required, especially when: (i) we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the Personal Data affected by the Personal Data breach, such as encryption; (ii) we have taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to your rights and freedoms is no longer likely to materialize; (iii) it would involve disproportionate effort, in which case, you will be informed in an equally effective manner like via a public communication or other.

15.6 In addition to the above, we comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act (“the Eraser Law”) as far as it is applicable to our Service. This law provides additional protections to individuals under the age of 18 in California, including a right to be forgotten, which enable minors to remove their own posts (but not republications of their posts or posts about them by others). The Eraser Law also prohibits companies who operate websites or online services directed at minors from using the minor’s personal information to market or advertise certain enumerated products and services deemed potentially harmful for them.
15.7 Data Breach Notification under Cal. Civ. Code §§1798.29, 1798.82 and 1798.84.

Last modified: August 22nd, 2023
At Proton, we strongly believe in an internet where privacy is the default.
Proton’s Privacy Policy describes how Proton collects, uses, and deletes your data. In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information specific to our products that use your personal data. This product-specific information can be found in the following privacy policies :
By using the proton.me or protonvpn.com website and making use of a Proton Account (the “Account”) and all its related features, including Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, Proton Drive, Proton VPN and Proton Pass (the “Services”), you understand that your data in relation with your use of our Services is processed according to the following privacy policy and its product-specific privacy policies (together, the ""Privacy Policy""). The Privacy Policy states (i) what data we collect through your access and uses of the Services; (ii) the use we make of such data; and (iii) the safeguards put in place to protect your data. The Privacy Policy is to be read and understood as being a complement to our terms and conditions.
1. Legal framework
The Services are operated by Proton AG (the “Company”, “We”), domiciled at Route de la Galaise 32, 1228 Plan-les-Ouates, Geneva, Switzerland. It is therefore governed by the laws and regulations of Switzerland. Additional information about the legal framework can be found in our transparency report.
We are also GDPR compliant. The designated representative of the Company in the European Union (notably for the purpose of art. 27 GDPR) is Proton Europe sàrl, rue de Grünewald 94, L-1912 Luxembourg.
2. Data Proton collects from you, and how we use it
Our overriding policy is to collect as little user information (personal data included) as possible to ensure a private user experience when using the Services. We do not have the technical means to access the content of your encrypted emails, files, calendar events, passwords, or notes.
Data collection is limited to the following:
2.1 Visiting proton.me or protonvpn.com website: We employ a local installation of self-developed analytics tools. Analytics are anonymized whenever possible and stored locally (and not on the cloud). IP addresses are not retained and stored for such analytics.
2.2 Account creation: Depending on the Services you want to use, you can either create a Proton account with a Proton Mail address, or use an external (non-Proton) address.
Creating a Proton account will give you access to all our Services. It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an Account. You can provide an external email address for notification or password recovery purposes. Should you choose to provide it, we associate this email address with your Account (for password recovery or notification purposes). Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about the Services, to send you information related to security, to verify your account or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may also inform you about Proton products in which you might have an interest. The legal basis for processing is consent and you are free to modify this in your Account settings panel at any time.
You also have the possibility to use our Proton VPN, Drive and Pass services with an external address. In this case, you have to provide your external address, which will be used as your account identifier. You can choose at any moment to create a Proton email address for this account to use Proton Mail and Calendar, too. Your email will only be used to contact you with important notifications about the Services, to send you information related to security, to verify your account or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may also inform you about Proton products in which you might have an interest. The legal basis for processing is consent and you are free to modify this in your Account settings panel at any time.
In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers, we use a variety of human verification methods. Verification may also be requested for some sensitive operations besides account creation in order to protect against brute-force attacks. You may be asked to verify using either Proton Captcha, hCaptcha (or reCAPTCHA in the event that hCaptcha is unavailable), email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and for anti-spam purposes. The period of temporary data retention is determined by our legitimate interests of protecting the service from spam, and also by any applicable Swiss legal requirements we must comply with.

2.3 Referral program: Proton has a referral program that is open to Proton users, publications, non-profit organizations, etc. If you are coming to Proton via such a referral program, your subscription may be attributed to the referrer. Some referrals are managed internally by Proton while others may rely upon third-party platforms used by the referrers, and if you are coming to Proton via a referrer, our site may communicate with such referrer platforms for the purposes of crediting referrers.
2.4 Account activity: The processing activities carried out by Proton for the operation of our different Services may vary depending on the Service. These activities are described in the specific Services' Privacy Policies.
2.5 IP logging: By default, we do not keep permanent IP logs in relation with your Account. However, IP logs may be kept temporarily to combat abuse and fraud, and your IP address may be retained permanently if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (e.g. spamming, DDoS attacks against our infrastructure, brute force attacks). The legal basis of this processing is our legitimate interest to protect our service against nefarious activities. If you enable authentication logging for your Account or voluntarily participate in Proton's advanced security program, the record of your login IP addresses is kept for as long as the feature is enabled. This feature is off by default, and all the records are deleted upon deactivation of the feature. The legal basis of this processing is consent, and you are free to opt in or opt out of that processing at any time in the security panel of your Account. The authentication logs feature records login attempts to your Account and does not track product-specific activity, such as VPN activity.
2.6 Communicating with Proton: Your communications with us, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff. We may also rely on third parties, such as Zendesk (see below). If you use Proton's live chat support, you consent to having the data contained within your live chat interaction processed by Zendesk Inc, the provider of Proton's live chat support platform. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more efficiently and improve the quality of our Services. The information you provide when you contact our support team is processed for analytics purposes (such as to obtain aggregate statistics), but we do not do any targeted advertising or any profiling.
2.7 Communicating with Proton's Sales team: if you are a Business customer or a business prospect and are contacting our Sales team via the dedicated forms, the data you provide is used solely for the purpose of processing your request and contacting you to assess whether our products will suit your needs. The legal basis for this processing activity is your consent.
2.8 Payment information: We rely on third parties to process credit card, PayPal, and Bitcoin transactions and must therefore share payment information with them. We do not retain full credit card details, we only save your name and the last 4 digits of the credit card number. Anonymous cash or Bitcoin payments and donations are accepted. We may use your account data for payment-related matters, including but not limited to sending you emails, invoices, receipts, notices of delinquency, and alerts to update payment information. The legal basis of these processing activities is the necessity to the execution of the contract to provide the Services. In order to respect the principle of data minimisation, we reserve our right to remove payment information from our systems that is no longer valid, without notice.
2.9 Native applications: When you use our native applications, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information. We may use mobile analytics software (e.g. fabric.io(new window)) app statistics and crash reporting, Play Store app statistics, App Store app statistics, or self-hosted Sentry crash reporting to send crash information to our developers in order to rapidly fix bugs. Some platforms, such as Google’s Play Store or Apple’s App Store may also collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, which may be governed by their respective privacy policies and terms and conditions. Such statistics can include most commonly used devices and operating systems, total number of installs and uninstalls, and the total number of active users.
Our applications do not access or track any location-based information from your device.
2.10 Social Media: We are active on Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter, Reddit, and Mastodon. Any information, communication, or material you submit to us via social media platforms is done at your own risk without any guarantee of privacy. We cannot control the actions of other users of these platforms or the actions of the platforms themselves. Your interactions with those features and platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
2.11 Links to other websites: Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, we are not responsible for the content of any website that we link to, and external sites are governed by their own terms and conditions and privacy policies.
3. Network traffic that may go through third-parties
Proton's alternative routing technology allows Proton Services to bypass many censorship blocks, but in doing so your network traffic may go through third-party networks, which we do not control. This could enable a third party to record your IP address or see that you are using Proton apps (the same information that your internet service provider is able to see). These third parties cannot see your actual data, which remain encrypted. By default, alternative routing is not used for Proton apps unless they detect that censorship measures are active on your network. Alternative routing can also be disabled in the settings panel of our mobile and desktop applications. However, doing so may cause you to be unable to access your Account from a network that is censoring Proton. Learn more(new window)

We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are legally obligated to do so by a binding request coming from the competent Swiss authorities. We may comply with electronically delivered notices only when they are delivered in full compliance with the requirements of Swiss law. Proton’s general policy is to challenge requests whenever possible and where there are doubts as to the validity of the request or if there is a public interest in doing so. In such situations, we will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted. Under Swiss law, subjects of judicial procedures have to be notified of such procedures, although such notification has to come from the authorities and not from the Company. Under no circumstances can Proton decrypt end-to-end encrypted content and disclose decrypted copies. Aggregate statistics about data requests from the competent Swiss authorities can be found in the transparency reports listed in our products-specific policies.

V. How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
We will only store your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the collection purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. If we are required by law to store your personal data beyond this period (such as for tax and commercial law reasons), we will delete the personal data at the end of this storage period.
After the expiry of the aforementioned retention periods, we will delete or anonymise your personal data.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use and disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and the applicable legal requirements.
If, after you sign up for our promotional emails, you unsubscribe from receiving our promotional emails, we will delete your personal data from our mailing lists. However, we will continue to store your email address in a blocklist to ensure that you will not receive any further communication.
VI. How We Disclose Your Personal Data
At times OnePlus may make certain personal data available to other companies that are wholly or jointly controlled by us (""Affiliates"") and other third parties that work with OnePlus in order to provide Services to you. Your personal data will not be shared with third parties for their own independent marketing purposes.
• Affiliates: Your personal data may be shared with OnePlus's Affiliates for the purpose of rendering our Services to you. If Affiliates wish to process data for a different purpose, they must first seek your consent, unless another lawful basis exists.
• Service Providers and Partners: Some of our Services will be provided with the assistance of third parties. We may also share some personal data with our partners in particular so as to deliver you a better service and improve your user experience. For example, when you use the security centre app, third-party service providers are used to scan for viruses and free up storage space on your phone, and we engage third-party service providers to provide you with enhanced customer service. We may also rely on service providers to identify and serve targeted advertisements, provide email services, provide tax and accounting services, organise competitions and deliver web hosting or analytics services. Any such service providers will, through appropriate data processing agreements, be bound to only process personal data on OnePlus's behalf and under our instructions, unless such service providers act as independent controllers.
• Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction: Where a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation or similar action takes place, we may transfer or disclose your personal data to a limited, but necessary extent to the applicable third party.
• Law enforcement, regulators and other parties for legal reasons: We may also disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law, or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a subpoena or other legal proceedings, legal actions or government agency requests; (b) when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (c) to protect and exercise our legal claims, rights and property; (d) to protect your rights, property or personal safety or that of others; (e) to investigate fraud and (f) to protect the security or integrity of our Services.
• The public, when posted in certain public spaces: Some of our Services allow you to connect and interact with others. Your profile information or information that you post in a forum or on a blog, including personal data, will be accessible to other users or the general public by default when you create it. Such content will be accessible by the general public or the members of the Service depending on the Service used.
• Otherwise with consent: We may disclose your personal data to certain other third parties with your consent.
VII. How Your Personal Data Is Transferred Globally
1. We leverage our resources and servers around the world to provide Services. We have data centres in the U.S., France, Singapore, India and Indonesia, which means that in compliance with applicable laws, your personal data might be transferred to or accessed from countries or regions outside of where you use our Services.
2. Please note that different countries or regions offer different levels of data protection. This means that your personal data could be stored in a country that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than the country or region in which you are located. However, in such cases, we will take measures to ensure that the personal data we collect is processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws, and that your personal data is adequately protected. For example, we might ask your permission to transfer your personal data across borders, and we will implement adequate security measures (such as encryption and de-identification where feasible) and sign the necessary data transmission/sharing agreements with the recipients of your personal data prior to the transfer taking place. We will also specifically ensure that we comply with laws that require us to store data locally within a specific country or region.
VIII. How We Protect Your Personal Data
1. The security of your personal data is very important to us. We have taken reasonably practical, technical and organisational measures in accordance with industry standards to protect personal data collected in connection with our Service and prevent it from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. However, please note that while we have taken reasonable measures to protect your personal data, no websites, Internet transmissions, computer systems or wireless connections are absolutely secure. In particular:
• Where appropriate, we will de-identify your personal data to mitigate the risk that other organisations or individuals may identify you on the basis of that personal data. We may also implement full security encryption during storage and transmission to prevent your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure (such as by using SSL to encrypt many Services). We regularly review practices regarding personal data collection, storage and processing (including physical security measures) to prevent unauthorised access to or tampering with our various systems and your personal data.
• We only allow our employees and personnel of authorised service companies to access such personal data on a need-to-know basis, in order to process such personal data or provide relevant Services to you. These employees and external personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held liable and/or their relationship with OnePlus may be terminated.
• When transmitting and storing special categories of personal data, we use extra security measures, such as encryption of the transmitted content. We also use technical measures to process your personal biometric information so that we only need to store essential data (such as basic parameters necessary to identify a person, but not the raw facial and fingerprint data).
• We carefully select our business partners and service providers and ensure that they are sufficiently bound to protect personal data and will be subject to privacy audits and assessments.
• We conduct security and privacy protection training, testing and other activities to enhance employee awareness of and proficiency in personal data protection.
• We use international and industry-recognised standards to protect your personal data and actively pursue relevant security and privacy protection accreditation.
• We promise not to sell personal data to any third party and guarantees the legitimate and fair use of user information only to the extent permitted by law.
2. In case of a personal data security incident, we will act in accordance with applicable law and notify you and/or the competent data protection authority of any such security incident where required, and take measures to mitigate any risks arising therefrom.

We are entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, and we may refuse requests that are manifestly unfounded, unreasonably repetitive or that require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests that require the development of new systems). In addition, we may not respond to requests that directly concern significant issues of public interest or may cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of you or other individuals or entities.
X. How We Process Children's Personal Data

2. If we discover that a child's personal data has been collected, we will delete the corresponding data as soon as possible.
3. If you believe that we might have any personal data concerning a child, please contact us using the ""Contact Us"" section.
XI. Third-Party Websites

2. We do not control third-party privacy and data protection policies and do not accept any responsibility or liability for such policies.

Log Information.
When you use the Application, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:

Metadata.
Metadata refers to technical data associated with user content. Put simply, metadata is data that describes data. For example, metadata can describe the analysis results of facial features, the characters in photos, and other elements contained in photos, which are generated and tagged by the computer algorithm and artificial intelligence. When you use the Services, we will use photo metadata to provide you with certain features including precise “Facial Recognition,” “Key-Points Recognition, “ “Region Segmentation, “Content Tags” and other custom features based on a combination of these basic features. We may use your photo metadata to provide you with more suitable filters and better photo effects when the Application processes your photos; we may also make use of the metadata to serve up more contextually relevant products or services to you.
Face Recognition.
B612 uses face recognition technology to recognize faces in photos, videos, and camera experiences.
We detect facial marks to provide face recognition contents and facial manipulation features - specifically, to apply filters and makeup on the appropriate face position.
We do not use such information for identifying a specific person. This information is processed in real-time for providing features of the Application.
Certain features (filters, effects, etc.) will send, store, use and process facial recognition information, metadata, or images to/on our servers, which may include designated portions of third-party cloud service providers’ servers that we control. We permanently deletes all such information when the initial purpose for collecting the facial image data no longer exists, or, if earlier, within three (3) years of your last interaction with us.
You must expressly consent to our collection and use of such facial recognition technology and data in order to use the Application and you may not use the Application without providing such express consent.

We may collect device and usage information such as:
- Mobile ad identifiers such as iOS Identifier for Advertising(IDFA) and Android Advertising ID(AAID)
- Information about the possible relationships among different devices.
- Data about user activities (e.g., the pages you view, the time and duration of your activities in the App) that helps us determine how a user interacts with advertising or content, such as determining whether a user who viewed a particular advertisement ultimately purchased the advertised product or service.
We may collect this information when the Application runs in the background on your device.

< Main Page.
Open Camera is developed by Mark Harman.
Open Camera accesses and records camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos and recording videos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera. Microphone permission is also used for the optional ""Audio control"" options.
Open Camera requires permission (at least for Android 9 and earlier, or using versions of Open Camera older than 1.48.3) to ""access photos, media and files on your devices"" (storage permission), as this permission is required for Android to save resultant files such as photos and videos to your device.
Location permission is requested in order to deliver the optional geotagging features (for photos and videos, including stamp and subtitles options). When relevant option(s) are enabled, your device location will be stored in photo/video/subtitle files.
Bluetooth permissions are used to allow the optional feature to discover and connect to Bluetooth LE remote control devices; the Bluetooth remote control feature also requires location permission (on Android 11 or earlier) or Nearby Devices permission (on Android 12 or later).
Resultant data such as photos or videos can be shared with other apps if you use the share option in Open Camera, or when Open Camera is called by another app on your device, or when you use the Storage Access Framework option to save to another app or service.
Data handling procedures, data retention and deletion policies: Open Camera does not transmit personal or sensitive information to me.
Since Open Camera also uses operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts. For example:
For versions 1.49.2 or earlier: the optional voice control option used the Android speech recognition service. When enabled, audio data is likely to be sent to remote servers by Android to perform speech recognition. This is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, located at https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/ , as updated from time to time. This option is no longer available in version 1.50 onwards.
, as updated from time to time. This option is no longer available in version 1.50 onwards. For versions 1.49.2 or earlier: The ""addresses"" option for photo stamp or video subtitles used the Android Geocoder API. When this option is enabled, in order to deliver this functionality the API transmits your device location data across the Internet to a third party (which may depend on what ""backend services"" are installed on your device). This option is no longer available in version 1.50 onwards.
Apps/services such as cloud services on your device may auto-upload photos and videos that are saved on your device.
If you have inquiries about my privacy policy, please contact me by email at mark.harman.apps@gmail.com.

You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).
These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, Adobe websites recognize the Global Privacy Control available in some web browsers. If your browser is configured to send this signal, Adobe will opt you out of Adobe’s use of advertising cookies on that browser. You can learn more about Adobe’s advertising practices [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing.html] and your privacy choices at [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html].

Additionally, many of our Services and Software allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the ""my account [https://accounts.adobe.com/],"" ""my profile,"" or a similar feature of the service you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our Services and Software by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection.

For example, to register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID, and to use some Adobe Services and Software, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you, or provide you with the Services and Software requested.

(1) We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information.

1. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Sweet Selfie. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services. Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below. 1) Information you give us You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes: When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.
When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.
When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.
When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.
If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.
Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services. 2) Information we receive from others In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including: • Other Users Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.
• Social Media You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Sweet Selfie account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us

With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses. 3) Information collected when you use our services When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details: • Usage Information We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g. date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).
• Device Information. We collect information about your device, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers (including MAC address and IMEI), browser type and language, mobile device phone number, and mobile network information. We also collect certain device information that will help us diagnose problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services. So, for example, if we detect a crash or other problematic event, we may collect the list of apps on your device and other information about your device’s performance at the time of the event for troubleshooting purposes.
• Camera and Photos. Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. We’ll access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.
3. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that store information about your use of the Services, which authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features. Web beacons are small pieces of software on a webpage or email that help us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User. And we use third-party advertising agencies to place advertisements on the Internet or in other media. To measure the effectiveness of the advertisements and determine how much to pay to the advertising agencies, we install third-party modules within the App. We may also install third-party modules within the App in order to help us understand how the Service is used. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Sweet Selfie, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing). These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.

Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future. Where we process personal data in connection with performing a contract, we keep the transactional data for six years from your last interaction with us (or such longer period as may be required by law). Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical constraints.

Code § 1798.80(e) No Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law No Commercial information Yes Biometric information No Internet activity or electronic network activity information Yes Geolocation data Yes Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information Yes Professional or employment-related information No Non-public education information (per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C.

The California Consumer Privacy Act also provides California residents with the right to opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Under the CCPA, a “sale” is broadly defined as making available personal information to a third-party for valuable consideration. It does not necessarily mean money was exchanged for the transfer of personal information.
For purposes of the CCPA, a “sale” may include using targeted advertising services to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other sites. Like most mobile applications, we use these services, which enable us to provide the Services and relevant offers to you. As a result, Meitu may “sell” the following categories of personal information: identifiers (e.g., advertising IDs); internet activity; geolocation data; and inferences drawn to create a profile.
California residents may opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information by turning off the switch next to “Do not sell my personal information”.
If you are a resident of California, every year we will provide you free of charge with an opportunity to obtain a list of third parties to which we have disclosed or with whom we have shared your personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the previous year.

You own all the rights for your works, but if you do not have a specific permission to use an image, we can’t provide you with that permission.
The content we licensed through our collections is provided with a license (as detailed in the full terms). If you import content from outside our collections (including via our web-search or custom fonts), you may do so, but you are required to receive permission from the copyright holders. This means that we don’t claim any ownership of your images.
Also, we may allow you to backup your photos, or to share them with your friends via other social networks, all according to functionality of the services.

When we have a good faith belief that we are required to provide information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other applicable law or legal process (learn more [https://www.adobe.com/legal/lawenforcementrequests.html]), or to respond to an emergency involving the danger of death or serious bodily harm;
If we merge with or are acquired by another company, sell an Adobe website, app, or business unit, or if all or a substantial portion of our assets are acquired by another company, your information will likely be disclosed to the prospective purchaser, our advisers and any prospective purchaser's advisers and will be one of the assets that is transferred to the new owner.
We may disclose or publish aggregate information that doesn’t specifically identify you, such as statistical information about visitors to our websites or statistical information about how customers use the Adobe Experience Cloud [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html].
Is my personal information displayed anywhere on Adobe’s websites or applications?
There are several places within Adobe’s Services and Software that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, participate in message boards or chats, engage with blogs, share technical information, or submit other content for others to see. Sometimes you can limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other users of the service. Such information can appear in search engine results or through other publicly available platforms and can be “crawled” or searched by third parties. For example, when users post content on message boards, online chats, blogs, and Community Forums, the information posted by the user will become public. Some online content may remain accessible publicly even after Adobe fulfils a request to delete the poster’s personal information.
Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name and/or profile photo may be included and displayed with your message. You can find more information about managing your public profile here [https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/edit-adobe-account-personal-profile.html].
To remove content you have shared on our Services and Software, please use the same feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us[https://www.adobe.com/go/privacyinquiry].
Is my personal information secure?
We work hard to protect your personal information. We employ administrative, technical, and physical security controls where appropriate, such as encryption, 2-step verification, and appropriate contractual obligations for employees and contractors.
Where does Adobe store my personal information?
Your personal information and files are stored on Adobe’s servers and the servers of companies we engage to provide services to us.
Does Adobe transfer my personal information across national borders?
The main locations where we process your personal information are the US and India, but we also transfer personal information to all other countries in which Adobe or its affiliates, providers, and partners operate. We carry out these transfers in compliance with applicable laws – for example, by putting data transfer agreements in place to help protect your personal information.
If you reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Ireland. Where Adobe Ireland transfers your personal information to a country which is not within the EEA and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms: European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, and/or your consent in certain circumstances. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review upon request, using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. For more information about how Adobe Ireland transfers European personal information, please see Cross-border data transfers [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html].

Adobe has also certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (as does its U.S. subsidiaries Marketo Inc, Magento (X-commerce, Inc) and Workfront Inc.). Adobe has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF (as does its U.S. subsidiaries Marketo Inc, Magento (X-commerce, Inc) and Workfront Inc.). If there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

As set out above Adobe uses a limited number of third-party service providers to assist us in providing our services to our users and business customers. These third parties may access, process, or store personal data in the course of providing their services. Adobe maintains contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and Adobe remains liable if they fail to meet those obligations and Adobe is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).
The information above applies to Adobe users who are consumers. More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about Cross-border data transfers [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html].
What rights do I have regarding my personal information and how can I exercise these rights?
When provided for by applicable law, you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller. You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).
These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, Adobe websites recognize the Global Privacy Control available in some web browsers. If your browser is configured to send this signal, Adobe will opt you out of Adobe’s use of advertising cookies on that browser. You can learn more about Adobe’s advertising practices [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing.html] and your privacy choices at [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html].
To exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us – or our data protection officer – using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our Services and Software allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the ""my account [https://accounts.adobe.com/],"" ""my profile,"" or a similar feature of the service you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our Services and Software by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.
If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Ireland's lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.
When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional. For example, to register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID, and to use some Adobe Services and Software, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you, or provide you with the Services and Software requested. Other optional information, if not provided, may impact our ability to provide a personalized experience or tailored content or offerings.
What rights do I have in my state?
In addition to the rights above, see Additional US State Privacy Rights for more information [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/us-rights.html].
Withdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing
The Adobe family of companies (see list of Adobe entities [https://www.adobe.com/about-adobe/contact/offices.html] and our acquired companies [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policies.html]) and companies we hire to help market our Services and Software on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Adobe.
Where we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time by:
updating your preferences in your Adobe ID profile;
updating your preferences in your specific website or app accounts;
clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails; or
contacting us using the details provided at the end of this privacy policy.
Click here [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html] for further information on your choices regarding our marketing practices.
What information is collected by companies using Adobe Experience Cloud solutions?
Adobe Experience Cloud solutions help our business customers personalize and improve the performance of their websites, apps, and marketing messages. For example, these customers may use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to collect and analyze information about how individuals use their websites (learn more [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html]). The information collected is stored in our services on behalf of and for use by these business customers.
How long does Adobe retain my information?
When you register for an account and create an Adobe ID, we process and keep most personal information we process on your behalf for as long as you are an active user of our Services and Software. We delete certain personal information we collect about you when we no longer have a business reason to retain it. Additionally, there is some personal information we need to retain even after you close your account to comply with business and legal requirements, such as personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you, which we retain for ten years after your last interaction with us.
Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in the future.
Can children use Adobe Services and Software?
Adobe Services and Software are not intended for minors under the age of 13, except in limited situations where certain Creative and Document Cloud applications may be available to children for educational purposes under the direct supervision of a teacher or parent.

Will this privacy policy change?
Occasionally, we may update this privacy policy (or other documents in the Adobe Privacy Center) to allow Adobe to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we do, we will change the ""last updated"" date at the top of this policy and the revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it. We encourage you to periodically review the Adobe Privacy Center [https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html] for the latest information on our privacy practices. Under certain circumstances (for example with certain material changes or where it is required by applicable privacy laws) we will provide notice to you of these changes and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. Notice may be by email to you, by posting a notice of such changes on our Services and Software, or by other means consistent with applicable law.
Who can I contact with questions or concerns?
If you have a privacy question, concern, or request, please fill out a privacy inquiry form [http://www.adobe.com/go/privacyinquiry].

Esta aplicación puede que monetice tu información, cediéndola a terceras empresas (en algunos casos), tu IIP e información de usuario, en las siguientes situaciones:
Cuando la app se monetiza mediante publicidad, las redes de publicidad y/o los anunciantes que proveen los anuncios pueden requerir cierta información del usuario o del dispositivo para poder así ofrecer el anuncio más apropiado para el usuario o que más interés le pueda despertar. La app puede utilizar redes como Mobincube, Startapp, Airpush, Tappx, Facebook, Amazon, Google o Docomo, entre otras.
Cuando contratamos redes de publicidad independientes para mostrar el banner de publicidad de nuestra aplicación cuando visita páginas web de terceros. Para hacerlo de una manera más eficiente, la red de publicidad puede que utilice e inserte en su dispositivo cierta tecnología, como el caso de las cookies, para recoger de usted información no personal cuando visita nuestra aplicación. Esta información es utilizada para mostrar anuncios sobre bienes y servicios que mejor se adecuen a sus intereses cuando visite otras páginas web.

7. ¿Habrá terceros que recojan información de sus aplicaciones?
Hay ciertas situaciones donde un tercero puede recoger información de la aplicación. Esta app utiliza librerías de terceros que ofrecen cierta funcionalidad: herramientas de análisis, herramientas de comunicación, redes sociales, anunciantes, etc.
Herramientas de análisis: para mejorar la aplicación, en ocasiones utilizamos herramientas que analizan el comportamiento de los usuarios. Así podemos saber qué partes de la aplicación son más importantes y cuáles hay que mejorar.
Herramientas de comunicación: por si en algún momento necesitamos comunicarnos con los usuarios, integramos herramientas de terceros que facilitan esta comunicación, ya sea mediante notificaciones push, emails, alertas dentro de la app, etc.
Redes sociales: si tu app en algún momento conecta con alguna red social, te pedirá autorización. Una vez autorizada la conexión, la red social podrá acceder a cierta información.
Redes publicitarias: en el caso de que esta app mostrase publicidad, normalmente proviene de redes publicitarias que conectan con los anunciantes. Estas redes necesitan cierta información para poder proporcionar el anuncio más adecuado para ti.
Esta aplicación se reserva el derecho a dar cierta información del usuario a empresas que colaboren con nosotros o a desarrolladores de software que proporcionan alguna funcionalidad de la app. Proveemos este tipo de acceso a tales empresas con el objetivo de generar interés en nuestros productos entre los miembros con los que tenemos algún tipo de acuerdo así como para permitir llegar a usted y a sus amigos el tipo de producto que ofrecemos. La información recogida por nosotros será tratada de acuerdo con los términos de esta Política de privacidad, pero el uso de la información por parte de un tercero será tratada según sus propios estándares. Esta aplicación no garantiza que la otra parte cumpla su política de seguridad.
8. ¿Qué tipo de medidas de seguridad tomamos para salvaguardar su información personal?
La seguridad y la confidencialidad de su información es extremadamente importante para nosotros. Por esa razón tenemos medidas de seguridad técnicas, administrativas y físicas en orden para proteger su información personal frente a acceso no autorizado y uso fraudulento. También revisamos nuestro sistema de seguridad periódicamente para insertar las novedades tecnológicas y métodos de actualización. No obstante, a pesar de nuestros esfuerzos, ningún método de seguridad es completamente perfecto e infalible.
Usted también puede jugar un rol importante en mantener su información guardada de forma segura. Si a usted se le requiere crear una contraseña única para restringir el acceso a su cuenta, elija una contraseña que sea difícil de averiguar por otros usuarios, y tenga la precaución de no revelarla a nadie. Es su responsabilidad guardar su contraseña y la información de su cuenta en todo momento. Si usted usa un dispositivo móvil público o compartido, nunca le dé a guardar usuario y cierre en todo momento la sesión de su cuenta cada vez que deje de utilizar el dispositivo.
Finalmente, respecto a las empresas que tienen un acuerdo con esta aplicación, les requerimos que acepten proteger nuestros términos de confidencialidad, integridad y seguridad de cualquier información personal que compartamos con ellos. Cuando su información personal sea compartida o simultáneamente recogida por un tercero tal y como se exponía anteriormente, o será obvio para usted teniendo en cuenta el contexto (tal y como la aparición de un tercero en la pantalla del teléfono) o será notificado en el momento en que la información personal sea reclamada. Además, se le dará la oportunidad de aceptar o declinar este tipo de prácticas antes de que se inicien. Tal y como se estableció en la sección 3 de esta Política de privacidad, no recogemos información personal de niños menores de 13 años y les informamos de que no deben hacer uso de nuestra herramienta en ningún caso. De este modo, esta aplicación no compartirá información recogida de los menores de 13 años con ningún tipo de empresa que haya firmado un acuerdo de colaboración.
En caso de que detectásemos que alguno de nuestros partners tecnológicos pusiera en riesgo tu integridad o utilizase tu información para llevar a cabo cualquier acción ilegal, tomaremos las medidas oportunas para cortar la relación con dicho proveedor.

Si tiene algún tipo de duda o desea ponerse en contacto con nosotros para aclarar cualquier punto, por favor envíenos un e-mail a la dirección del desarrollador que encontrará en la página desde la cual descargó la presente app.

Esta aplicación se reserva el derecho a modificar la presente política de privacidad en cualquier momento, aunque no es habitual. Cualquier cambio en las políticas normalmente irá acompañado de una actualización en la versión de la aplicación. Al inicio de estas políticas puedes encontrar el número de versión y la fecha en que se han editado. En caso de proceder a un cambio material en cómo recogemos, usamos o compartimos la información personal, añadiremos estos cambios en una nueva versión de estas políticas.
11. Aclaraciones respecto al uso del ID de publicidad de Android
La versión 4.0 de servicios de Google Play ha introducido nuevas API y un código identificador (ID) que pueden utilizar proveedores de análisis y publicidad. A continuación se indican las condiciones de uso de estas API y de este ID.
Uso. El identificador de publicidad de Android solo se utiliza con fines de publicidad y análisis de los usuarios. El estado de la opción para inhabilitar la publicidad basada en intereses se debe verificar en cada acceso del ID.
Asociación a información de identificación personal u a otros identificadores. El identificador de publicidad no se vincula a información de identificación personal ni se asocia a cualquier identificador de dispositivo persistente (por ejemplo, SSAID, dirección MAC o IMEI) sin el consentimiento explícito del usuario.
Respeto de las selecciones de los usuarios. Tras el restablecimiento, el nuevo identificador de publicidad no se vincula a un identificador de publicidad anterior o a datos derivados de un identificador de publicidad anterior sin el consentimiento explícito del usuario. Asimismo, se ofrece la opción para inhabilitar la publicidad basada en intereses del usuario. Si un usuario ha habilitado esta opción, no se utiliza el identificador de publicidad para crear perfiles de usuario con fines publicitarios o para llegar a usuarios con publicidad basada en intereses. Entre las actividades permitidas, se incluyen la publicidad contextual, la limitación de frecuencia, el seguimiento de conversiones, la elaboración de informes y la detección del fraude y de la seguridad.
Cumplimiento de las condiciones de uso. El identificador de publicidad solo se utiliza de acuerdo con estas condiciones, incluido el uso que haga de él cualquier parte con la que puedas compartirlo durante la actividad comercial. A partir del 1 de agosto de 2014, todas las actualizaciones y las nuevas aplicaciones que se suban a Play Store deben utilizar el ID de publicidad (cuando esté disponible en un dispositivo) en lugar de cualquier otro identificador de dispositivo con fines publicitarios.
12. Aclaraciones respecto al acceso a tu número de teléfono
Esta app no se ha desarrollado para obtener el número de teléfono de tu teléfono y no se le ha añadido ninguna funcionalidad que permita obtenerlo. La app no incluye ninguna línea de código que permita acceder al número de teléfono.
La app incluye algunas librerías (SDK) de terceros, utilizados en el caso de monetizarse con publicidad. No tenemos acceso al código fuente de dichos SDKs de terceros, alguno de los cuales acceden y recogen el número de teléfono. En caso de que detectásemos que alguna de estas redes publicitarias realizase tales prácticas, lo quitaríamos de inmediato y publicaríamos una nueva versión de la aplicación, para proteger tu privacidad.

The Site collects personal information about you from your social media accounts, but only if you opt-in and permit us to do so. When you connect to us through a third-party service like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, we receive information from that third party identifying your account. We collect and store this information and use it to help you connect to our Site and to share your public content. Connecting your IPSY account to a third-party service is completely optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect. You can revoke permission by logging into the third party service and disconnecting the IPSY application from there, and through the native applications on your smart phone. We may retain the information we collected previously from you. When You Opt-In to Receive Text Messages. When you opt into SMS messages you provide your express written consent for IPSY to contact you through the phone number you provide. When you opt-in to SMS Messaging Services, we will send you an SMS message to confirm your signup. Message frequency varies. You may cancel the SMS Service at any time. Reply “STOP” to cancel and “HELP” for assistance. The SMS Messaging Service is provided by participating third-party mobile phone/wireless carriers. Message and data rates may apply. If you have any questions regarding your text or data plan, please contact your mobile phone/wireless carrier. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. When You Participate In a Contest or Promotion. When you participate in contests and promotions, we collect and process information that is necessary to perform our contract with you and allow you to participate in contests and promotions offered or sponsored by IPSY, our co-marketing partners, and sponsors. This includes your personal identifiers (such as your name and email address). Your personal information may be shared with our co-marketing partners and sponsors to allow them to fulfill their contest obligations and for subsequent marketing offers and resources, newsletters and other company updates, in accordance with your marketing preferences. When You Interact with Our Chat Bot. When you go to our help site for information and interact with our virtual assistant, the Glam Bot, we may record your chat. The recording may be used for training purposes or to track any issues or concerns you bring to our attention so that we can improve our site or services. We kindly ask that you not include any sensitive personal information or credit card numbers in your chat. We may, however, ask you for information like your name or email address only for purposes of locating your account so that we may better serve you. Please note that IPSY does not sell or share any personal information that you may provide to the Glam Bot with third parties. Information We Automatically Collect or Receive. Log Files. Like most sites, IPSY automatically receives and stores in log files certain information from your browser when you visit the Site. This information includes your Internet protocol (""IP"") address, browser type, Internet service provider, the referring/exit pages, your operating system, and the date/time stamp of your Site visit. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies Policy. We use a variety of technologies to help us understand how you use IPSY.com, our IPSY apps, and our services so that we can provide you with a better experience. This guide explains the tracking technologies IPSY uses and is part of our commitment to a high standard of transparency in our privacy practices. (i) Types of tracking technologies Cookies. This is a small data file sent from a server to your web browser that is stored in your browser and sent back to the server each time the browser makes a request to the server. Cookies can improve a site user's experience by, for example, allowing the site to keep a user logged in while browsing, saving a user's site preferences, and allowing a user to add items to a shopping cart and preserve cart contents between site visits, even when the user is not logged in.
Clear gifs, web beacons, tracking pixels. These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier. They function similarly to cookies and are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded on web pages and are single pixel wide. Tracking pixels helps us to understand the effectiveness of different parts of the website so that we can offer content that is relevant to you.
Geolocation If you have turned on location services in your mobile device, we may collect information about your geolocation. If you do not want us to collect this information, you may turn off location services on your smart phone. Turning off location services will not affect your ability to access the app.
SDKs. Software development kits (“SDKs”) are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application. (ii) Tracking Technology Lifespans Single-session tracking technology : lasts only as long as your site visit. Single-session cookies expire and delete themselves when you leave the site or close your browser. They are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation through a site or generating aggregated statistics about how a site is used. Single-session cookies do not publicly expose your personal information.
Multi-session or persistent tracking technology: remains on your browser or mobile device until you choose to delete it or the cookie expires. Persistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited a site. This can improve the user's experience, for example by continuing preference settings from previous visits and by allowing users to login without entering a password with every site visit. (iii) Tracking Purposes We use tracking technologies for these general purposes: Because it is strictly necessary . This tracking is needed to make IPSY work properly.
For performance . This tracking helps IPSY understand how the Site is functioning so IPSY can improve the Site.
For functionality . This tracking retains your personal preferences as you use the Site.
For advertising. This tracking helps us to refrain from delivering advertising to you that is not of interest to you (iv) Cookies IPSY currently uses Single session cookies are used to ensure the Site displays correctly on your device.
Persistent cookies are used to measure Site metrics such as which pages are popular, how often people visit the Site, whether people are visiting the Site for the first time, and whether visitors make purchases on the Site. They also are used to enhance Site functionality, for example to allow returning users to use the Site without logging in. (v) Cookies for email subscribers We may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our email communications and to tailor email content. For example, we may connect the data showing that you clicked a link in an email from IPSY then completed an action on our Site such as buying a Glam Bag. This links cookie data with an individual user, so we only do this for users who have consented and opted in to receiving emails from IPSY. (vi) Third Party Cookies IPSY partners with third-party service providers who set cookies and tracking pixels for Site visitors and members on our behalf in order to deliver their services. These services include targeted online marketing and analysis of data collected through cookies. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you visit IPSY.com or other sites that also utilize the third party's services, but do not allow access to personally identifiable information from IPSY. Third parties may choose to include IPSY widgets on their sites. When you load a site that has chosen to include our widgets, we receive analytics information through a cookie that may be used to enhance our data or to improve our services. IPSY does not have access to or control over these third-party technologies, and they are not covered by our Privacy Policy. (vii) Managing Cookies You can delete cookies stored in your browser at any time. You also can choose not to accept cookies from any site, including IPSY.com, by changing the settings of your browser. If you reject or block all cookies in your browser settings, then you will not be able to fully use IPSY's services. (viii) Do not track IPSY does not currently take steps to respond to browsers ""Do Not Track"" signals as no uniform standard to respond to such signals has been developed at this time. Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control browser choice referenced below. Information from other sources. We may receive information about our users from third party social platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram. When you access or use our site or mobile application through such a site, you allow us to access or collect information made available by the third party site in accordance with its privacy policy. This information may be available from your profile or account with the third party site or from cookies placed on your device by the third party site. Depending on your privacy settings this information may include: Facebook interests, gender, friends and location. Information collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit the Site. This information includes your IP address, device ID, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring site address.This information also includes your operating system or application, your location, and your activities voluntarily have submitted to us (for example, your email address). Information collected from your mobile device When visiting any of our mobile applications, we may use an advertising identifier created by your mobile operating system to store information on our servers and later retrieve it. The Android Advertising ID and Apple iOS IDFA are examples of advertising identifiers. For more information about advertising identifiers, please check the settings of your mobile device. Other Information We Receive About You. As you might expect, we usually collect or receive information through our Services. But we also may collect information offline, and it's important to us that we preserve the privacy of your personal information both online and off. For example, if you enter a drawing or request information at one of our live events such as IPSY Live, we may ask for your email address. We treat offline information collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our online privacy practices. If you're not an IPSY member but we contacted you, then we may have received your contact information from one of your friends. An IPSY member may give us your name and email address so IPSY can send a personalized invitation to you to join IPSY. We also may send you personalized email ‘reminders' about IPSY from your friends. Similarly, an IPSY member may provide your personal information to us so we can ship a gift or other merchandise to you. We ask your contacts to share your personal information only with your permission, and you may unsubscribe from any marketing email you receive by following the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of the communication.
WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION Information we collect from you may be either personal or aggregate. Personal information is identifiable to you, like your name, email address, shipping and billing addresses, credit card information, and phone number. Aggregate information is summary data of the behaviors and interests of groups or categories, so it won't identify you. Aggregate Information. We use aggregate information for the purposes of internal business research, sales and business development and reporting back to our brand partners. We may share aggregated information about our visitor and user base with third parties such as our Retail Partners. This information may include the number of daily visitors to our Site and the number of orders placed on a certain date. We also may share Beauty Profile information with brand partners. We do not link aggregated data with our Ipsters' personal information. Personal Information. We use your information to fulfill transactions requested by you and to send you offers of products and services that may be of interest to you, and for the purposes described above. The following describes the limited circumstances in which we may share your personal information: Disclosures to IPSY Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties. Like most Internet retailers, we use third parties to help ensure our business runs smoothly. We disclose your information to these third-party companies so they can perform their specific functions for us. For example, we may provide your name, shipping address, email and phone number to third-party shippers like the U.S. Postal Service, the United Parcel Service or DHL to deliver our products to you. We also may provide your credit card information to third-party credit card processors and issuers to help us process your orders from us. IPSY’s third party vendors may recognize a tracking code used by your browser or application to enable you to receive customized content, or to enable you to use other technologies such as tags and scripts. The tracking code may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you. When we employ other companies to perform functions of this nature, we only disclose the information that they need to perform their requested function. We do not authorize them to retain, share, store, or use personal information provided by us for any other purpose. Disclosures Required by Law or Otherwise. We may disclose your personal information if we believe, in good faith, that it's necessary to: (1) comply with a legal obligation such as in response to a court order or subpoena; (2) protect the safety of fellow Ipsters or the public; (3) protect against legal liability; or (4) protect and defend IPSY's rights or property. Disclosures for a Business Transaction or Insolvency. We also may disclose your personal information in connection with an actual or proposed corporate transaction or insolvency proceeding involving all or part of IPSY's business or assets. For example, if we merge with another company, we may disclose your personal information to that company, but the disclosure would be subject to our Privacy Policy. Disclosures through Social Media. Remember that you control the privacy settings on each of your social media platforms. We allow you to share information from the Site to social media. In order for this to happen you first must opt-in. You can revoke permission to do this by logging into the social media service and disconnecting the IPSY application from there. Disclosure to Affiliates. Affiliates are companies that are owned or controlled by IPSY. We may share your personal information with our Affiliates in order to bring new product offerings to you. Disclosure to Third Parties. Occasionally, we may share personal information with third-parties including: to other users: We may provide our users with the ability to interact among themselves via user forums or discussion threads that allow users of the Sites to share information or exchange products among other users. You should be aware that any information you provide on these forum and discussion threads - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses the Sites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these forums and discussion threads. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if We are unable to and why;
to our brand partners: We use aggregate information for the purposes of internal business research, sales and business development and reporting back to our brand partners. This information may include the number of daily visitors to the Sites and the number of orders placed on a certain date. We also may share product reviews with brand partners. We may also share the product reviews you post with our brand partners who may repost your reviews about their products on their websites or social media channels owned and operated by those brand partners;
to our advertising partners: We may partner with third party advertising networks, exchanges and Social Networking Services (like Facebook) to display advertising on our Sites or to manage and service advertising on other sites and we may share personal information with them for this purpose;
to third partiesy providing search results and links (including paid listings and links);
third party marketers: We may disclose your personal information to third party marketing cooperatives to enhance our marketing efforts and to offer new products and services to you; and
to any other person or entity with your consent to the disclosure. Fraud Prevention and Credit Risks: We use personal information, such as your personal identifiers (including your name and contact details), financial information (including your payment details), and commercial information (such as your purchase history and tendencies) to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in order to protect the security of our customers, IPSY, and others and we rely on our and third parties' legitimate interest in promoting the safety of our Services and in protecting our rights and the rights of others. We may also use scoring methods to assess and manage credit risks. Where we need your consent to collect and use your personal information under applicable data protection laws, we will ask for this at the relevant time and make clear the purposes to which you are consenting. ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on the Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in the “Information We Automatically Collect or Receive” section above to help us analyze how users use the Site, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on. Tailored Advertising
We may allow certain third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site by non-affiliated, third-party ad technologies, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human-readable form. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's (“DAA”) Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Site, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above links. When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertising content. Each operating system--iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices--provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.

YOUR RIGHTS In addition to the choices described above, the laws of your jurisdiction (including Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, and Utah) may provide you with certain rights as to your personal information. Applicable law may permit you to request that we: Confirm whether or not we are processing your personal information and provide you with access such personal information;
Correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information;
Delete your personal information;
Provide you a copy of personal information that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another business, where our processing is carried out by automated means; and
Opt you out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal information, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service. If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at IPSY Data Request or by calling, toll free 1-855-661-0018. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, social media, email addresses, etc.). You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise directed by us. IPSY may use your personal information to send you targeted advertising. Targeted advertising (as defined in applicable law) is advertising based on a consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites to predict the consumer’s preferences or interests. To opt out of targeted advertising, please visit this link: Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information. If we deny your request to exercise any of the rights above, you may appeal that denial by sending an email to privacy@ipsy.com describing in detail why you believe the denial was in error. Your description must include your full name and the email addressed used for your account with IPSY along with a copy of the denial notice you received from IPSY.__________
PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION At IPSY, we take data security seriously. We use industry standard technical, physical and administrative safeguards to secure our customers’ data. Online, we encrypt your personal information using Transport Layer Security (“TLS”). TLS allows for a private, reliable Site connection where your identity is authenticated with cryptography. Offline, we restrict access to your personal information to only those IPSY employees who need it to perform a specific job function. We require all IPSY employees with access to your personal information to follow specific security protocols concerning its proper handling. We also hold our vendors who need access to your personal information to strict confidentiality and security requirements. Third-party service providers assist us with the physical security of some of our computer hardware. When you visit our Site, you access servers that we backup constantly. Our servers are hosted at locations which are private and secure data center facilities, behind physical and virtual firewalls. Please remember, however, that while we use industry-standard security measures to safeguard your personal information, we can't guarantee absolute security. We wish we could, but 100% security just doesn't exist anywhere online or off. We recommend that you do your part by keeping your passwords secure, changing them often and not using the same password across multiple accounts.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY We respect children's privacy. The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 (see IPSY's Terms of Use). We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under age 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us personal information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@ipsy.com. If we confirm we collected such information, we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. If you're 16 years old but under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent/guardian's written permission to have an account and we ask that you not submit any personal information to us or post on our Site without the consent and supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian.
NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS If you’re a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information and sensitive personal information that we have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which the information was collected, the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by applicable law) for which the information was collected, and the categories of parties to whom we disclose personal information. Throughout this Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we share it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the ""categories"" of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for “business or commercial purposes” (as those terms are defined by applicable law). The categories of personal information are identifiers (such as name, address, and email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card and other financial account information); internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address); geolocation information; inference data about you; physical characteristics or description (such as when you complete our beauty quiz); audio and visual information (such as when you call into customer service), legally protected classifications (such as your gender), and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. The categories of sensitive personal information are account log-in and password or other credentials allowing access to your account, and precise geolocation. We or our service providers collect and disclose the above categories of personal information for the purposes described in our Policy. This includes the following business and commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law): Provide the Services (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, order processing and fulfillment, customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about the Service);
Operational purposes (e.g. to enable and troubleshoot our Service);
Auditing consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions);
Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting security incidents and fraudulent or illegal activity;
Bug detection, error reporting, and activities to maintain the quality or safety of our Service;
Short-term, transient use, such as customizing content that we or our service providers display on the Service;
Improving our existing Services and developing new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop new products or features);
Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third-party advertising and communicating with you about relevant offers from third-party partners;
Other uses about which we notify you. We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly from you; (2) through your use of the Services; (3) affiliates; and (4) third parties such as other users and social networks. We describe our information disclosure practices in the Policy above. We may disclose certain categories of personal information to third parties (as defined by the CCPA) for the business purposes described above. For example, we may disclose identifiers (such as name, address, and email address) with our Brand Partners so that they may fulfill your order and ship products directly to you, and contact you about that product. Rights of California Consumers
If you’re a California resident, you may have certain rights. California law may permit you to request that we: Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, “selling,” or “sharing” your personal information; the categories of third parties to whom we disclose or “sell,” or with whom we “share,” personal information; and the categories of personal information we “sell.”
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.
Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you. You have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service. If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at IPSY Data Request or by calling, toll free 1-855-661-0018. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, social media, email addresses, etc.). You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise directed by us. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us. The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such sales. Some people have taken the position that when a website uses third parties’ cookies or similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app. Some take this position even when the website pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of providing personal information to the third party. As part of these analytics and advertising services, these technologies may access identifiers (like IP addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchase of beauty product) to those sorts of companies. While IPSY does not believe these are “sales” as that term is defined under the CCPA, you can opt out of this activity. In addition, IPSY shares identifiers (like your email address) and internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site) with our Brand Partners so they can send you information about their products, which may qualify as a “sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of these activities by visiting this link: Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information. The CCPA also requires businesses that ""share“ personal information to provide an opt out from such sharing. Under the CCPA, ”sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites. We “share” information for these purposes to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. As part of this advertising, we may ""share“ identifiers (like IP addresses and email addresses), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on our Site), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering a beauty purchase) with advertising platforms and advertising networks. To opt out of such “sharing,” please visit this link: Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information. Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control. Any opt out preferences you have exercised through these methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them. For more information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, see www.globalprivacycontrol.org. We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of children under 16. We will only “sell” or “share” such personal information if we receive express consent to do so from those aged 13 to 16 years of age. The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information other than for purposes for which you cannot opt out under the CCPA. Retention of Your Personal Information Please see the “Data Retention” section below. Notice of Financial Incentive We provide certain rewards or incentives for customers to provide product reviews, referring friends and contacts, and follow creators (the “Points Program”) and occasionally run sweepstakes and contests where participants may provide personal information in return for a chance to win or compete to win certain prizes. You can opt into the Points Program, sweepstakes, or contest by taking the requested action. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you have a right to withdraw from these incentives at any time. If you decide you don’t want to participate in these financial incentives, you can refrain from taking the request actions. For more information on the Points Program, see: https://www.ipsy.com/blog/ipsy-points-faq. For more information on sweepstakes and contests, see: https://www.ipsy.com/contest-terms. The specific reward or incentive offered, if any, is made available to you when you provide the information requested, submit a review, or follow a creator. The monetary value of the reward or incentive is a reasonable approximation of the monetary value of the information you provide us. We have arrived at this estimate based on consideration of multiple factors, including the following: (1) revenue generated by IPSY in developing insights on our customers; (2) expenses incurred by IPSY in operating the Points Program; and (3) our reasonable assessment of revenue we may generate as a result of the referrals provided to us by our customers. Shine the Light Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as the “Shine the Light” law), IPSY customers who are residents of California may request certain information about our disclosure of personal information during the prior calendar year to third parties.

We may request your consent for a number of activities including:

(f) Transfer of Data . Goldberg Imports transfers data to the United States for processing. We may request your consent for this transfer or the transfer, in other cases, may be justified by a legal basis other than consent.
(g) Automated Processing . Goldberg Imports may use some automated processing to provide our Services and to make recommendations in the context of specific Services. This processing is strictly necessary for providing certain Services (and, in some cases, is the service itself) and is not covered by consent. Other automated processing is not significant either due to the nature of the data or the decisions being made or recommended, and so consent is not required. However, for automated processing that is significant and related to sensitive Personal Data, prior to sharing or using such data, Goldberg Imports will first seek your consent. For the subset of automated processing included in ad profiling for ad targeting, you can change your consent status (for Website Services) by disabling advertising cookies.
(h) To Enable Social Sharing and Connect with Us on Social Media . Some of the Services consist of social sharing and communication with others. If you sign up for such Services, Goldberg Imports may ask for your consent to use your information to enable sharing as described in the Service.

Internet-Based Advertising
Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and Internet usage over time and across websites. Goldberg Imports’s advertising practices also include the creation and use of “audience segments”. You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. You may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies. Additional information choices for interest-based advertising is found below. For all of the interest-based advertising described, you have the choice to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising—including third party advertising—regardless of where such ads might be served. These opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit Ad Choices (US), Your Ad Choices (Canada), or Your Online Choices (EU) for more information regarding opting-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region. These websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works. Opting-out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet; rather, it means that the data collected from the Website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests.
Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent
You may, at any time, withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding Website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and device preferences. Depending on the Services, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work. Goldberg Imports provides you with several ways to manage your preferences:
(a) Cookie Use and Controls . Cookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users. Cookies are used to remember you and personalize your web experience and for security, analytics, marketing, and interest-based advertising. Goldberg Imports’s cookies are placed and read by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by other companies’ web servers. You can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section. If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our website and Services will not work.
(b) IP Address Use . An IP address is an identifier assigned by a network to a computer, mobile device, or routing device. Goldberg Imports’s advertising and analytics partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.
(c) Web Pixels or Beacons . Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request. Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.
(d) HTML5 Local Storage . HTML5 local storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (i.e., to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5 local storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above and in our browser settings.
(e) Flash Cookie Use . Flash cookies are “local shared objects” used by Flash player to store data, similar to cookies. If you have Flash installed, and wish to delete, block, or manage Flash cookies, please use the Flash settings panel made available by Adobe.
(f) Social Networks . Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Websites passively transmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow a social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited. This is the case where social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is “clicked”, “pressed” or “selected”. If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.
(g) Mobile Device Advertising ID’s, Location and other Data Use . Goldberg Imports’s Services may transmit Device ID’s, Location Data, and data from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners. Device IDs include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier, platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple's IDFA, and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi address and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system. Goldberg Imports’s Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi access points. Goldberg Imports may use Device IDs, coarse location and Location Data, and data from sensors, including the local network, for strictly necessary purposes; improving our Services and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app, cross-device, interest-based advertising.
(h) Withdrawing Consent for Use of Mobile Device ID’s, and for Analytics and Advertising . Activating the “Limit Ad Tracking”, “Opt out of Ads Personalization”, or equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to Goldberg Imports and any third parties that we use and when that signal is received by Goldberg Imports or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have Device IDs used for purposes of advertising or analytics. Goldberg Imports honors the signal and requires that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same.
(i) Consent Settings for Communication . After signing up for email communications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link in any commercial email we send. If you use more than one of Goldberg Imports’s Services, then unsubscribing from the emails relating to that Service may not stop you from receiving emails from other Services. Please note that if you unsubscribe from all emails, then this means that you have unsubscribed from all emails other than strictly necessary emails. You will still receive email communications from us if they are strictly necessary to provide the Services or to confirm or validate a transaction, recover accounts, etc.

4.2. We shall not associate a permanent device identifier with other personal data, sensitive user data, or resettable device identifiers, except for the following purposes:
For telephone services associated with SIM identity information (e.g., Wi-Fi calling services linked to a specific carrier account).
For enterprise device management applications operated in owner mode.
Should any of the aforementioned purposes apply, We will conspicuously disclose such usage in our privacy policy and within the application.
4.3. We shall not employ sensitive information permissions and APIs for collecting user data or device data in undisclosed, unimplemented, or unauthorized functions or purposes. Furthermore, for the purpose of promoting sales, We shall not sell or share, without user consent, personal or sensitive data obtained through sensitive information access permissions or APIs.
4.4. User or device data accessed through restricted permissions is considered as personal and sensitive user data. If You decline to grant restricted permissions, We will respect Your decision. We will take reasonable measures to enable users who have not granted sensitive permissions to use the application as normally as possible. However, You understand and acknowledge that some of our services may not be available if You do not grant Us these permissions.
4.5. SMS and call records are considered as personal and sensitive user data. The usage of related permissions will be subject to the constraints of this privacy policy and the following limitations:
Call Log Permission Group: If users choose to, they are entitled to actively register the application as the default phone or assistant handler for the device. We will not set it to automatically retrieve in the background.
SMS Permission Group: If users choose to, they are entitled to actively register the application as the default SMS or assistant handler for the device. We will not actively collect and will not set it to automatically retrieve in the background.
4.6. Device location information is considered as personal and sensitive user data. We will not collect such information. We will also not request users to grant location information permissions for the purposes of advertising or data analysis.
Even if using location information is necessary to provide existing features or services, We will request Your explicit consent. The application will only request the minimum necessary permissions (i.e., requesting approximate location information rather than precise location information, foreground permissions rather than background permissions), and the level of location permission requested for respective features or services should be within the reasonable expectations of the user.
4.7. The file and directory attributes on the user's device are considered as personal and sensitive user data. If, for certain features that are essential to providing the application service, We need to access the device storage, We will only request access to the device storage that is crucial for its operation.We will not access Your device's camera or files without obtaining Your consent.Further,We will not request access to the device storage for purposes unrelated to providing key application functionality, or to do so on behalf of any third party.
If the application targets Android R and requests broad access to shared storage (""All Files Access Permission""), We will clearly prompt You to enable ""All Files Access Permission"" for our app under the ""Special App Permissions"" settings.

This requirement applies whether Your personal data is transmitted after being sent to servers or through the transmission via embedded third-party code in our application.
Business Transfers: Upon Your prior approval,as We continue to develop our business, We might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Luvmehair or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Luvmehair and Others: We release account and other personal information when We believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Luvmehair, our users, or others.

However,sometimes it may be necessary—by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside Your country of residence—for Us to disclose personal data.

2. Account registration
Registration on Overwolf or CurseForge is optional. If you choose to register to either Overwolf or CurseForge a dedicated account will be created (the “Account”). Your Account allows you to participate in certain Services, subject to the Terms and the Overwolf Privacy Policy, which is available at Privacy policy. Overwolf reserves the right to refuse to allow a User to open an Account for any reason, or to limit the number of Accounts a User can establish with respect to the Services, all at Overwolf's sole discretion.
To create an Account, you must select a username and password. Your username is your Overwolf or CurseForge identity. You may not select a username that is used by someone else, and your username cannot be indecent, or otherwise offensive, or be used in any way that violates these Terms and common practices. You may not provide false information during the registration process. You must provide truthful and accurate information while creating your Account.
You should not reveal your password to other users. Overwolf will not ask you to reveal your password. If you forget your password, you can request to have your password reset.

Grounds for such termination may include but shall not be limited to (i) extended periods of inactivity, (ii) violation of the letter or spirit of these Terms, (iii) fraudulent, harassing or abusive behavior or (iv) behavior that is harmful to other users, third parties, or the business interests of Overwolf.
If Overwolf believes, at its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms or any illegal or inappropriate behavior has occurred, we may take any other corrective action we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms or illegal and inappropriate behavior on the Services. We will fully cooperate to a court order requesting or directing us to disclose any information we might have including the identity of anyone believed to have violated these Terms or to have engaged in illegal behavior on the Services. You may request termination of your Account at any time and for any reason by sending an email to support@overwolf.com. Any suspension, termination, or cancellation shall not affect your obligations to Overwolf under these Terms (including but not limited to ownership, indemnification, and limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, termination, or cancellation.
4. Payments
App and mod developers decide and control how to monetize their apps and mods. Some may choose to provide them free of charge, some may choose to place ads, some may choose to ask for a paid subscription managed by Overwolf and some may provide links to third party payment systems (for which Overwolf has no liability). Overwolf facilitates those services for some of the app and mod developers by partnering with select partners and providing an SDK/API to easily control and manage the payments. When a Member signs up for a subscription, it will automatically charge him/her the applicable payment every month. The subscription months will be calculated from the date of payment. The Member may cancel the subscription at any time, such that s/he will continue to receive the benefits in connection with the subscription until the end of that month and his/her subscription will end at the end of that month. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend offered subscription plans at any time in accordance with these Terms. Subscription prices may change, including recurring subscription fees from time to time and we will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the applicable Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
Overwolf currently facilitates payments through PayPal, Xsolla's platform and Tebex. Xsolla is also an authorized global distributor of the Platform. Overwolf may add or change payment methods in its sole discretion. You must respect the terms and conditions of any payment methods you use. We reserve the right to cancel any Services ordered if full payment is not timely received. We reserve the right to cancel any transaction that we have reason to believe to have been fraudulently made, including by unauthorized use of a credit card, debit card, or other payment method.
You are solely responsible for any taxes on amounts you may pay or obtain through the Services. Overwolf will deduct applicable charges and taxes from any payable amounts, as required by law.

A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:

is the browser and operating system being used. 740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.
For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.
Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. Learn more
If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more.
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.
For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more
For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.
For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

59,org.lds.ldssa,Gospel Library,Books & Reference,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,5M+,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/services/platform/v4/resources/privacy-policy,"In this Notice, we, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its entities, provide you with information about how we process your personal data. When referring to ""us"" or ""we"" or ""our"" we mean the Church and Church entities.
1. Who controls your personal data?
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acts through its representatives and Church entities when we process your personal data. When you share personal data with us, you are sharing it with the Church through Church entities.
a. The Church: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the ""Church"") is a community of people who believe the same religious doctrine, practice the same religious rites and ordinances, and are governed by ecclesiastical principles. Local units of the Church, such as wards, branches, stakes, districts, missions, and areas, are merely subdivisions of this community of believers and are not separate legal entities; limited exceptions apply.
b. Church entities: To satisfy temporal affairs needs and fulfill other purposes of the Church, a legal structure composed of various distinct legal entities assists the Church throughout the world. These distinct legal entities (herein ""Church entities"") are legally separate from the Church. One of those Church entities, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Utah corporation sole, together with one or more other Church entities, processes your personal data as responsible joint data controllers. Some Church entities may receive personal data as data processors to provide services to those Church entities that act as data controllers. At your request, we will provide you with information as to which Church entities process your personal data.
2. What personal data do we collect?
We collect personal data that (a) you actively submit to us, (b) we record, and (c) we obtain from third parties. We may process your personal data with or without automatic means, including collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, analysis, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of your personal data.
a. Actively submitted data. You submit personal data to us when you join the Church, seek Church ordinances, request Church materials, request access to Church tools or services, or engage in other interactions or communications with the Church. When you interact with the Church, we generally process name, birth date, birthplace, telephone number, email address, physical address, photo, gender, donation/payment information, and so on. You may provide us with additional information to participate at your own initiative in surveys, contests, or other activities or events, including when you participate in video or audio recordings, such as when using video conferencing technology. Participation in surveys, contests, and similar activities is optional. If you do not wish to participate in, or provide personal data in connection with, such activities, this will not affect your membership status or ability to use available Church tools or services. In each such case you will know what personal data you provide to us because you actively and voluntarily submit the data.
b. Data we obtain from third parties and passively submitted data. When local law permits, you may submit personal data, including contact information about someone other than yourself (in other words, a third party) to allow us to make contact with that person, make a delivery, or otherwise meet your request. When providing personal data about anyone other than yourself, you must first obtain the other person’s informed consent if his or her consent is legally required.
If you or someone else has provided us with your personal contact information and you would like to request that we do not contact you further, please follow the unsubscribe or opt-out procedures provided on the specific site, newsletter or email notification, or please contact us at www.ChurchofJesusChrist.org/DataPrivacy.
We may process and make publicly available personal data obtained from published sources. We may process and publish living information in compliance with applicable local laws.
Your location-based information may be collected by some mobile applications for the purpose of helping you find the nearest temple or meetinghouse location or for a similar reason. You can edit the settings on your device to opt out of location-based services.

3. For what purposes do we process personal data?
We process personal data for ecclesiastical, genealogy, humanitarian, social welfare, missionary, teaching, and other operational and administrative purposes.
We use personal data to provide ecclesiastical and other related services to fulfill the mission of the Church. We may use and analyze personal data (including data about how you use our tools and services) to (a) contact you or others, (b) create and maintain membership records, (c) fulfill requests you make, (d) seek your voluntary feedback, (e) customize or personalize features or content on our tools or services, (f) evaluate eligibility to participate in temple and other ordinances, missionary service, volunteer or leadership positions, or (g) administer Church religious education, welfare, or other Church programs. In this context, the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is either the necessity to perform contractual and other obligations that we have towards you or carrying out of our legitimate activities as a church.
We may also use your data to comply with applicable laws and exercise legal rights as the basis for our data processing.
We may also use your personal data for internal purposes, including auditing, data analysis, system troubleshooting, and research. In these cases, we base our processing on legitimate interests in performing the activities of the Church.
4. With whom do we share personal data?
We share your personal data with other parties in the following circumstances:
a. Third-party providers. We may provide personal data to third parties for their processing in performing functions on our behalf as data processors (for example, payment processing, maintenance, security, data analysis, hosting, measurement services, data-driven social media messaging, surveys, and so on). In such instances, in accordance with this Notice and applicable laws, the providers will be contractually required to protect personal data from additional processing (including for marketing purposes) and from transfer.
b. Church entities. We may transfer personal data to any Church entity to accomplish Church purposes. Your general membership information (if you are a member of the Church) and any optional information you may choose to provide (for example, email address and photo or video that you provide or that we capture with your permission) may be shared with Church members in your ward or branch and stake or district, or with other participants in a program in which you participate, as necessary for the Church purposes listed above. Some of your information may also be viewable on a limited and restricted basis on our internet resources, including ChurchofJesusChrist.org. You may opt out of sharing information or limit the optional information you share by modifying your profile preferences on individual resources or by contacting us using the information provided below.
c. Legal requirements. We may access and disclose your personal data, posts, journal entries, online chats, personal notes, content, or other submissions to any resource if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by a subpoena, by a judicial or administrative order, or is otherwise required by law. Additionally, we may disclose your personal information and other information: as required by law or to exercise or defend legal rights; to take precautions against liability; to protect the rights, property, or safety of the resource of any individual or of the general public; to maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services or infrastructure; to protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or to assist government law enforcement agencies.
5. Where do we store personal data?
We may store your personal data in data centers in the United States, in cloud storage solutions, or on the premises of Church entities. To ensure the adequacy of protection of data that we transfer to other jurisdictions, we have concluded data transfer and processing agreements between the respective Church entities and their service providers, which agreements include Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission in compliance with EU law (which you may be entitled to review if you contact us as suggested at the end of this Notice).
6. How do we secure personal data?
We use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data we receive against loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration and to protect its confidentiality. We regularly review our security procedures and consider appropriate new security technology and methods. We also use current encryption technology to encrypt the transmission of data on our log-in pages. However, because we cannot guarantee the complete security of these encryption technologies, please use caution when submitting personal data online.
7. How long do we retain personal data?
We retain collected personal data, including information collected via mobile applications and other submissions, for a reasonable period of time to fulfill the processing purposes mentioned above. We then archive it for time periods required or necessitated by law or legal considerations. When archiving is no longer required, we delete personal data from our records, with the exception of limited historical profile information, general genealogy records, and personal information retained as part of a permanent genealogical, membership, or Church historical record.
8. How can you access and correct your personal data?
We endeavor to maintain the accuracy of personal data and rely on you to ensure your personal data is complete and accurate. You may request access to your personal data and verify, correct, or rectify (including update) it, and block your personal data through your website-specific registration, through your profile, or through your Church Account, as applicable.
If you are a Church member, some of your personal data may be updated only by making changes to your Church membership record. Such changes must be made by contacting the clerk in your Church unit and requesting the change.
You may contact us to exercise additional statutory rights such as data portability, objection in accordance with applicable laws, restriction of processing, and erasure of your personal data. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
If you experience problems with modifying or updating your personal data, you can contact us as suggested at the end of this Notice.

Effective Date: November 13, 2023
We at Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation L.L.C., which is wholly-owned by HarperCollins Christian Publishing, Inc. (“Company”), respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) applies to personal customer information obtained by the Company, including through web sites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), emails, and widgets (collectively, the “Services”).
The Notice describes the types of personal information we obtain about customers, how we use the information and with whom we share it. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. The Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

Information We Obtain
We obtain personal information about customers through the Services, publicly and commercially available sources and from our Company affiliates and/or business partners (such as Olive Tree Bible Software, ChurchSource.com, Zondervan.com, and social media networks). The types of personal information we may obtain include:
Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone and/or mobile numbers);
Username and password when you register through our Services;
Geolocation data;
Other information you may provide to us, such as through our “Submit a Request” or “Contact Us” feature; and
Behavioral data such as website pages visited or time spent using our Services.
Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services
We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services. The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Services, and dates and times you access or use the Services. In connection with our mobile apps, we also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.
A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and store information regarding your actions while using our mobile apps.
We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Panel and Global Storage Settings Panel. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Services. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with us through our apps or other app developers.
In addition, if you register with us through or connect your account with us to a third-party social media network (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media network.
The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. The Company is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.

This Policy, which is incorporated into and is subject to the Webnovel Terms of Service, describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information.
1. Personal Information We Collect:
We may collect Personal Information about you from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Service if that information is necessary to provide you with it or if we are legally required to collect it.
User-provided Information. When you use the Service, we ask you to provide certain Personal Information about you, including your name, gender, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card or other billing information, your date of birth, geographic area, or preferences and we may link this information with other information about you. For example, we may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you register for an account, use the Service, or make a purchase on the Service. We may also collect any other Personal Information that you choose to provide to us. For example, if you decide to contact us with a request, we will process the content of your message, the date and time of your message, our response and any other Personal Information you provide in that context. If you contact us to apply for a job with Webnovel, we will process your job application, including your curriculum vitae and other Personal Information you submit to us in that context.
Automatically Collected Information. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs"" or “web beacons.” In this context, we may collect certain information about you, such as your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you. Please review your web browser “Help"" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Google provides some additional privacy options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ regarding Google Analytics cookies. Webnovel does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who visit our Site or who use our Service.

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for our continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. However, please note that, for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you at the time of your request (if applicable), we may not always be able to comply with your erasure request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground, because you consider that it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios where:
you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
our use of the data is unlawful, yet you do not want us to erase it.
you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
you have objected to our use of your data, yet we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide you, or a third party you have chosen, with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right applies only to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.",

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

The VCDPA requires companies and organizations to adhere to several duties when processing consumers data. In a nutshell, what the VCDPA requires from companies and organizations to do is to discover what personal data is processed, map out how and to whom they share personal data, and manage how personal data is stored, as well as protect personal data from breaches and abuse.

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

4.4 Balancing Legitimate Interests
Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough and will not cause any unwarranted harm. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.
4.4.1Systems, Apps and Network Security
We process Personal Information for network and information security purposes. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Information to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This primarily covers the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.
Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of cybersecurity technologies and services which may include hosted and managed cybersecurity technology services, it is necessary for the functionality of our systems, products and services and in our legitimate interests as well as in our users’, to collect and process Personal Information to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuri ng the security of our own, and of our users’ networks, devices, and information systems. This includes the development of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events (“cyberthreats”).

Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);
Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including phishing);
Reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);
Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files
attached to emails);
URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or
otherwise harmful contents); and/or
IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation,
distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).
Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Information concerning you or any other Data Subjects. However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting (by removing any personally identifiable elements) and mitigating the cyberthreats of concern to you, and to secure your network, device and systems. When processing Personal Information in this context, we do not seek to identify a Data Subject.
4.4.2 New Product Development
We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Information to develop new products or features so that we are able to provide you with state-of-the-art security, privacy and performance products.

5 How we protect your Personal Information

5.3 For the information we may collect from you or your child while using our products or services, yours and your child’s personal information collected in such circumstances will be kept confidential and shall not be used for illegal purposes, or copied, used or provided to any third party illegally, or accessed by our staff.
The information we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate. In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
A child’s participation or access to an activity cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.
5.4 We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We will not share your or your child’s information with third parties other than the necessary service providers as indicated in this Privacy Policy.
5.5 Limiting utilization may occur in the following circumstances:
With customers’ written consent;
When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;

To comply with laws or regulations, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;

6 How we use your Personal Information
6.1 Content of Email
We will not read or disclose to any third party any private email communication information that is transmitted using our products and services, unless given appropriate explicit consent to do so.
6.2 Log
We have provided logging functions for emails and other communications transmitted in the process of using our products and services. Any user can select to turn his own log record function on or off. We will not read or disclose to any third party any users’ private information it records as part of the logging functions without further consent.
6.3 UID information
When you use our products and services and activate/register them, our system will generate a user ID (UID) for you at random, by which we identify the user and provide the services. We may collect your phone number and associate it with UID and/or any of our other internal tracking tools or service account, such as Account to complete the billing process and provide certain service such as anti-lost remote control.
We respect the request of any user or third party to verify his own UID information, and will correct or allow the correction of any possibly incorrect information. Any user and third party can ascertain whether his information has been appropriately corrected by either email or phone at any time.
6.4 Caller ID & Call Block Function
When you use the Caller ID and Call Block function, we will collect, process and retain personal information from you and any devices you may use in your interaction with our Services. This information may include the following: geo-location, your IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device manufacturer and type, device and hardware settings, ID for advertising, ads data, operating system, operator, IMSI, connection information, usage statistics, device log and event information, the number of incoming & outgoing calls and other information based on your interaction with our Services.
Please note: the app will never store your contacts and your call history. The app accesses the contacts on the phone in order to display the contacts and so the app can record or ignore calls from specific contacts. While we are intensity focused on protecting you from unknown calls, we are just as concerned with making sure important calls are not missed. Access to contacts helps us filter out numbers that may look spam, but are actually legitimate (like your Doctor’s office). We also access contacts to identity callers under the name you prefer to see, to enable your ability to add numbers to your blocklist.
You can tag an unknown number after making a call. So this contribution will make our database better. We may also associate a name with a phone number through the numbers tagging functionality, which allows a user who receives a call from a phone number which is not associated with a name in the database to indicate a name to be associated with that number. A name will only be associated with a number through this functionality if a sufficient number of independent Users, based on our algorithm, have indicated the same name for the relevant number.

Stay Connected
Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.
Visitors have choices about how we use their data.
Stay Informed
Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.
Career
Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
Productivity
Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.

3. DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND ""AS AVAILABLE"" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, DURABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THAT STORED DOCUMENTS WILL BE PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. WHILE APRYSE ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES IS SAFE, APRYSE CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ITS SERVER(S) ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH, SO THEY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE DISCLAIMERS DO NOT OVERRIDE THE LEGAL PROTECTIONS (INCLUDING ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES) THAT ARE GRANTED TO CONSUMERS BY THE LAWS OF THE EU.
APRYSE DOES NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT ITS LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR APRYSE’S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE EXCLUSIONS BELOW ARE NOT ALLOWED, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE OR OUR BREACH OF THE TERMS. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT.
IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, IN NO EVENT SHALL APRYSE OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND AGENTS (""APRYSE PARTIES""), BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF INFORMATION), ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, INABILITY TO USE OR RELIANCE UPON THE SERVICES, EVEN IF APRYSE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
INDEPENDENT OF, SEVERABLE FROM AND TO BE ENFORCED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER ENFORCEABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISION OF THE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL APRYSE PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU (INCLUDING LIABILITY TO PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHTS CLAIMED BY YOU), WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE TERMS, THAT EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTH PERIOD, OR USD $10.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO EU CONSUMERS WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES WILL APPLY TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION AND WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS OR EFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER REMEDIES.
4. INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify and hold Apryse, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless of and from any claim, demand, or damage, including reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by any third party due to or arising out of your content or your use of or conduct with regard to the Services.
5. MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION
Apryse reserves the right to discontinue offering all or part of the Services or to modify the Services at any time, without any liability to you or anyone else in its sole discretion. For changes to paid offerings that, in Apryse’s reasonable discretion, result in a material diminishment of value to you, we will make reasonable commercial efforts to notify you of such modification or discontinuation. If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the Services at any time, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the Services. Apryse in its sole and exclusive discretion, may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if: (a) you violate the Terms either in letter or in spirit; (b) If you fail to make timely payments of fees for the Services; (c) if we are required to do so by law (for example, if providing software to a specific region becomes unlawful); and (d) if we choose to discontinue the Services, in whole or in part (such as if it becomes impractical for us to provide Services in your jurisdiction). If you are a user of a free account, Apryse may terminate the Services with or without cause upon 30 days’ notice to you. Upon termination of the Services, your right to use the Services immediately ceases. If we discontinue any Services in its entirety, then we will provide you with a pro rata refund for any unused fees for the discontinued Services that you may have prepaid. Termination of your account shall not relieve you of any obligation or liability accruing prior to such termination, nor preclude Apryse from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have under these Terms, at law or in equity, with respect to breach of these Terms.
6. CHANGES TO TERMS
Apryse reserves the right to change the Terms at any time and to notify you by posting an updated version of the Terms on the website or other reasonable means as Apryse deems appropriate. If you do not agree to these changes, then you must stop using the Services. If you do not stop using the Services then your use of the Services will continue under the changed terms. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by all of these Terms as amended by us from time to time.
7. SANCTION AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS
Any use of the Services shall be in compliance with all relevant international, U.N., Canada, USA or EU sales, export or import restrictions and regulations and you agree to comply with them. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to embargo, or that has been designated by the United States as a “terrorist supporting” country; and that you are not listed in any Canadian, United States or EU sanction list of prohibited or restricted parties and you comply with relevant sanctions and embargos.
8. GOVERNING LAW
These Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws (procedural and substantive) of California as if made and performed by and between parties situate in such jurisdiction and without regard to any conflict of laws doctrine. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any part of any transaction which may result from these Terms and the same is strictly excluded from these Terms. You and Apryse submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Santa Clara County, California and waive any objection as to venue in such courts. Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Apryse may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for interim or injunctive relief pending resolution of the dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries (including those in the EU) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This section does not override such laws.
9. BILLING AND RENEWAL
If you decide to purchase a paid subscription to any of the Services (or any particular features of the Services), you will be charged the stated fee in advance on a monthly or yearly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase. We may change the price for the paid subscription, including recurring subscription fees (for periods not yet paid), from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you at least 30 days in advance. Such notice may be provided by an email to you or in the form of an announcement on the Service. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Services after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you may reject the change by unsubscribing from the paid subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
We will automatically bill the subscription fee to your plan, price and payment method selected until your subscription is cancelled or terminated. If you do not terminate your subscription, it will be automatically renewed. You and Apryse may cancel or terminate your subscription at any time. Any cancellation will take place from the next billing period, i.e. any cancellation will only cancel future billings. We do not provide refunds except in cases requested by mandatory law or where otherwise explicitly communicated to you.

We do not claim any ownership rights to your content.
11. USE OF E-SIGNATURE FEATURES
Certain types of documents or agreements may be excluded from general electronic signature laws (for example, wills, trusts, court orders, or family law matters), or may have specific regulations that are applicable to them. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the documents you use with the Services are appropriate for electronic signatures, and Apryse is not responsible or liable for any such determination or use. Apryse does not guarantee that any electronic signature provided through the Services is legally binding in your country or under the laws of the country governing the legal transaction that is the purpose of the signing process. Apryse further disclaims any liability for contracts that are not closed, lost or signed out of time due to the usage of the e-signature tool.

Apryse uses TLS encryption. Apryse shall have in place and shall comply with documented written policies and procedures, periodically reviewed, covering the administrative and technical safeguards in place and relevant to the access, use, loss, alteration, disclosure, storage, destruction and control of information.

OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGIES
We use “cookies”, clear gifs, log file information, and other technologies and analytics technologies (“Cookies”) to obtain certain information when your browser or mobile device accesses our websites, applications, or other technologies. For example, when you log in to our websites, applications, or other technologies to apply for an employment opportunity, a session cookie is created while you are on the website, application or technology. This enables you to apply for multiple positions without having to log back into the system each time. If you do not wish to receive any Cookies, you should examine your browser settings and instructions, though we make no promise that they will be effective. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of the services provided on our website, applications or technologies.
Cookies allow us to understand what web pages you have viewed, what links you click, the searches you conduct on our websites, applications, and technologies, and how frequently specific pages are visited.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the website, applications or technologies, or our TrueBlue Services. Similarly, you may be able to adjust settings on your mobile device to limit the personal information it stores, and these adjustments may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the website, applications, and technologies, or our TrueBlue Services.
Your selection of a “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on the Cookies or the automatic collection of analytics information. This may be for a number of reasons. For example, not all Cookies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a Cookie; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in ""local storage"" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.
A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.
Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.
This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.
This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:

is the browser and operating system being used. 740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).
A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.
Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.
On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.
Additional Context
For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.
For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features. Learn more about Google Play Services.
Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:
When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more
If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more
The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. Learn more
If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more
For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.
Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:
We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. Learn more
A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail
When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.
When we detect spam, malware, illegal content (including child sexual abuse and exploitation material), and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more
Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.
For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more
For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. Learn more.
There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more
For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.
We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more
You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more
If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more
For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.
For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more
Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more
When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like ""Cooking and Recipes"" or ""Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.
Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.
For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.
Examples of these services include:
Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls
Gmail, for sending and receiving emails
Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages
Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages
Google Fi, for a phone plan
When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more
For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.
Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more
For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.
For example, we process information about requests to remove content from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.
For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more
This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information through our services. If you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the “data controller” of your personal information collected through the services (as defined in our Terms of Service). For everyone else, Discord Inc. is the data controller. It’s important that you read this entire policy, but here’s a summary to get you started: We care a lot about privacy . We are committed to creating spaces where people can come together and find a place to belong. Respecting user privacy is a key part of that mission.

We also use certain information to help us identify violations of our Community Guidelines and prevent harmful content from being distributed through the services. We give you control. We give you the ability to control your privacy on Discord. ‍ ‍
Discord is your place to find community We created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. Whether you’re part of a club, gaming group, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to express yourself and find community. Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service. They include the Discord app, which can be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information through other means like surveys, emails, and social media. If we build another product, our services include that too. As explained in our Terms of Service, we allow users to add content to the services in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger spaces. If you share content within larger spaces, that content may be accessed by many people, including people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these servers, and you should be aware that server owners or admins set these permissions, and like the size of a server, the permissions may change over time. We may also use content posted in larger spaces, to help us improve and power features like Highlights Notifications, identify harmful content on the services, and enforce our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. These things are important to us, and we believe they will make Discord even better for our users. We will always try to let you know the type of space you are in (although we don’t control where invite links are shared or the permissions for that server). You can limit the extent to which your content is used for these purposes as described in the “How to control your privacy” section below. You should take all of this into account when you are using our services, and choose the spaces, features, and settings that are most appropriate for your content. We make money from paid subscriptions and the sale of digital (and sometimes physical) goods, not from selling your personal information to third parties. ‍
The information we collect We collect certain information when you use Discord. This includes information you provide to us, information we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources. Information you provide to us Account information . When you create a Discord account, you can come up with a username and password, and provide a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You’ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames.

You’ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information (like a verified phone number) to your account. You may also have the option to add your name or nicknames. Content you create . This includes any content that you upload to the service. For example, you may write messages or posts (including drafts), send voice messages, create custom emojis, create short recordings of GoLive activity, or upload and share files through the services. This also includes your profile information and the information you provide when you create servers. We generally do not store the contents of video or voice calls or channels. If we were to change that in the future (for example, to facilitate content moderation), we would disclose that to you in advance. We also don’t store streaming content when you share your screen, but we do retain the thumbnail cover image for the stream for a short period of time. We may build features that help users engage with voice and video content, like create or send short recordings.

If you buy any paid services through Discord, you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address. Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the credit card number associated with the transaction. If you sell something through Discord, you may be required to provide additional information to our payment processors, such as bank account information to facilitate payments and copies of government issued identification required to identify users in accordance with regulatory obligations. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we would receive and process this information ourselves.

This also includes third-party integrations you choose to enable and the data you authorize those third-party services to share with us. For example, when you link a music streaming account, we may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so).

To contact you. We may use your information to let you know about new products or features we think you’ll like. You may opt-out of receiving such marketing communications. Where local law requires, we will obtain your consent before sending such communications. To comply with our legal obligations We retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we retain information where we are required by law or if we are compelled to do so by a court order or regulatory body. Also, when you exercise any of your applicable legal rights to access, amend, or delete your personal information, we may request additional information from you for the purpose of confirming your identity. ‍With your consent ‍We may also collect and use personal information with your consent, such as to send you marketing communications where legally required. You can revoke your consent at any time (mostly through our services directly), though note that you might not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal information. ‍To protect someone’s vital interests We may collect or share personal data if we think someone’s life is in danger—for example, to help resolve an urgent medical situation. ‍
How we disclose your information When you tell us to . When you add your content to the services, you are telling us to make that content available to certain people or communities. Who can access that information is determined by who can access a particular space. For servers, those permissions are set by server owners or admins. They control whether a server requires an invite link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, may change over time. Similarly, if you link your Discord account with a third-party service (like a music-streaming service or gaming platform), embed content, or participate in a server that has third-party features like bots enabled, we may provide certain information to that service or to other Discord users to operate that service or feature. Additionally, if you purchase goods or services from other users on Discord, we may disclose certain information to these users in order to facilitate the delivery of the goods or services purchased or help them understand and improve their business. We may also disclose your information as you otherwise instruct us or provide us your consent to do so.

We do this to help bring more users to Discord and make our business successful, and provide only the information required to facilitate these services. This may include information like the fact that you installed our app or registered to use Discord.

Data retention We retain personal information until we determine it is no longer needed for the processing purposes for which we collected or retain it or for legal compliance. You can learn more about data retention periods in our data retention policy. ‍
How we protect your information We take a number of steps to help protect your information. All information sent within our services is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees and contractors have access to nonpublic personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication. ‍
How to control your privacy We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including privacy. And while local laws may require different things, we believe that our users should have at least the same basic ability to shape their experience no matter where they are in the world. Here’s how you can control how we process your information, how to delete or correct certain information, and how to request access to your information. Users in certain places may have specific rights under their local laws. You can learn more about these in the relevant sections below. ‍Be aware of the Discord spaces you choose to participate in You can choose what communities to participate in and what information you add to our services. You can choose what messages to send or post, who to engage with (e.g., one or more particular users or a potentially unlimited group of users), what information to include in your profile, whether to connect any third party services to your Discord account, and more. For example, if you share content in certain spaces, such as servers listed in Server Discovery or with public invite links, your content may be accessed by anyone. ‍Customize your personal Discord settings We offer a number of settings that allow you to tailor your experience within Discord. Some of these relate to specific features: for example, you can choose whether to display your current activity (like the game you are playing or the music you are listening to) in your status in your User Settings page (this is the gear icon next to your username). You can also access other privacy-specific settings in your User Settings. For example, you can decide which types of direct messages are scanned for explicit content, who can add you as a friend, and more. This is also where you can limit certain types of processing of your information: Limit our ability to use your data to improve our services . We offer certain settings that allow you to limit the information we collect to help us understand how users use our services, what features or products they may want, or to otherwise help us improve our business.

International data transfers We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. These data transfers allow us to provide our services to you. By accessing or using our services or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the U.S. and other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. When transferring data outside the EEA, we use standard contract clauses (Module 1 and Module 2), and we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, or other legally compliant mechanisms or conditions for such data transfer. Discord and its U.S. entities/subsidiaries (Backgammon Merger Sub II, LLC, Brazos Games, LLC, Discord International, Inc, Flames Sub LLC, and Sentropy Technologies Inc.) also comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks, as well as the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If you have questions or complaints regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, please reach out to us at privacy@discord.com. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to a third party outside those countries. For more information about the Data Privacy Framework principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework site. ‍
Services offered by third parties We allow third party developers to build certain features or other services and offer them within the Discord services. For example, server administrators can add “bots” created by third party developers that provide features like content moderation and interactive games. Similarly, you may have access to games or activities built by third parties within the services. These third-party services need to follow all policies that apply to them (including often our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy). As part of these policies, we require developers to have a privacy policy that makes clear what they do with your information. Please review these privacy policies, as they describe what bots and apps may do with your information. We also require that certain popular bots apply for access to certain data. But because these services are operated by third parties, we don’t control them or what information they collect. It’s up to you whether to participate in a server that uses bots, and whether to engage with third-party services in general. ‍
Data Protection Officer You can contact Discord Netherlands BV’s Data Protection Officer at dpo@discord.com. We’ve appointed VeraSafe as Discord’s representative in the United Kingdom for data protection matters, pursuant to Article 27 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation. See the section “Contact Us” below. You can contact VeraSafe only on matters related to the processing of personal data. ‍
Information for Users in the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Brazil Certain local laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), require services to provide information about the information they collect, how they use it, and the lawful basis for processing it. We’ve described most of that already in the earlier portions of this Policy. ‍Exercising your rights: As described in the “How to control your privacy” section above, all our users have control over their information and can directly edit or delete information from their account and limit what data we process.

We also need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on a user’s behalf (where permitted), we may require proof of your written authorization before processing the request. Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request.

Additional Information for Users in California In addition to the rights described above, consumers residing in California are afforded the right to certain additional information with respect to their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act or (“CCPA”).

We receive and store any information you enter on our Website, send to us through the Services (including mobile applications), or via email or SMS, or knowingly provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, email address, gender, age range, mobile phone number, and any other information necessary for us to provide our Services. Although some information may be required to register with us, you can choose not to provide us with certain information; by omitting information, you may not be able to take advantage of some of our features or Services as a whole. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as providing the Services, answering your questions about the Services, and communicating with you about Talkatone’s products and Services, including specials and new features. We will only send you marketing in accordance with your expressed communications preferences.
We may also collect third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Google Voice, Facebook or other third-party sites) to help you take full advantage of the Services. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign into the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, if you sign in to Google Voice through our Services, we can access your information stored on your Google Voice account.
We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services, in accordance with your preferences. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and helpful and improve our Services by allowing Talkatone to use aggregated confirmation information. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at privacy-talkatone@ooma.com.
2.2 Other Information Collected Automatically:
We or third parties on our behalf may collect other types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use the Services (including mobile applications). For example, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device including your IP address, geolocation, device identifier, diagnostic data, “cookie” information, browser type, operating system information, and the page or feature you requested. We use this information for internal purposes such as providing the Services to you.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of calls to the Services and visitors to our Website, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. We only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Services or Website so that we can make them appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve them as necessary.
As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners (including advertisers) about how our customers, collectively, use our Services or Website. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Services or Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal level of service and online experience. Again, we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
If you are a user located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interest or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the Personal Information in question. If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us at privacy-gdpr@ooma.com.
2.3 What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your browser or device that enable our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. We may use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences and to learn more about their use of the Services and Website and to improve quality of the Services, including better Services options.
Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third-party website or service, such third party may transmit cookies to you. We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies you may go here, and to opt out of such ad networks’ and services’ advertising practices, go to Your Ad Choices and Network Advertising Initiative Choices. Once you click the link, you may choose to opt out of such advertising from all participating advertising companies or only advertising provided by specific advertising companies. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored / interest-based advertising. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. In addition, such changes may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
Where required by law, we process opt-out preference signals in a frictionless manner. If your browser supports it, you can turn on the Global Privacy Control (GPC) settings on your browser to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information.
2.4 What About Device Identifiers?
Mobile devices (such as iPhones, iPods, iPads, Android phones and tablets and Kindle devices) have unique device identifiers, including, as applicable, IDFA, UDID, serial, and IMEI numbers. Depending on your device and its specific settings, Talkatone may collect device identifiers in certain cases to guarantee that the Services won’t be accidentally interrupted, to enhance users’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Services and to improve quality.
You should consult your device’s privacy settings to understand how you can control this data collection.
Ads appearing through the Services may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may check your device identifiers. Device identifiers allow the ad provider to recognize your device each time they send you an advertisement to compile information about you. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of device identifiers by Talkatone and does not cover the use of device identifiers by any third party, including advertisers.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier tied to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content to you while you use the applications. In order to customize these ads or content, we or a data provider we have engaged may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address or data passively collected from you, such as your device identifier or IP address. If we do this, we will share your email address solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt- out your device from receiving ads through this method, please contact us at privacy-talkatone@ooma.com.
3. Will Talkatone Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?
Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. In some cases, we may share your Personal Information, but only as described below.
Information that’s no longer personally identifiable : We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.

However, we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. Advertisers : We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers. We also may provide any of the device-related information we have collected from you to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact that you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.

We won’t ever share the content of the email or text or your Personal Information with the Advertiser in connection with such Keyword sharing. However, the Advertiser may be able to associate your device information with matching Keywords in your use of the Services. To learn more about device identifiers (including UDIDs) and our Advertisers, please review the relevant portions of this Privacy Policy above.

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control : We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of third-party websites and businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell or provide products or services to you through the Services or the Website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your Third Party Account Information; for example, you can import information stored on your Google Voice account to use with the Services. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

Business Transfers : In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Talkatone, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Talkatone goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Talkatone may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Customer Specific Network Information : In the course of providing the Services to you, Talkatone will collect and maintain certain customer-specific network information. Customer Specific Network Information includes the types of products and services you currently purchase, related usage, and billing information for those products and services. Your telephone number, name, and address are not Customer Specific Network Information, nor is any information which cannot identify any individual. We value our relationships with our customers and are committed to respecting and protecting your Customer Specific Network Information. Accordingly, we will not sell, trade, or share your Customer Specific Network Information outside of Talkatone or with anyone not authorized to offer or provide our Services, or to perform functions on our behalf, except as authorized by you or as provided below. Generally, we can use your Customer Specific Network Information to offer additional services to you, and for billing and collections purposes.

4. Is Personal Information About Me Secure?
Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
Talkatone uses appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect user information and to ensure that user account information is kept private; however, Talkatone cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
5. Transfers of Personal Information
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process Personal Information necessarily involves the transmission of Personal Information on an international basis. Therefore, by using Talkatone, you acknowledge the transfer of your Personal Information outside your country of residence to any country where we have facilities or engage third parties (including the United States of America). You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of Personal Information protection as in your country.
For users located in the EEA, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including Section 7 below. These include implementing agreements based on and our own compliance with the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfer of personal information outside the EEA. Further details can be provided upon request.
EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding GDPR may contact our GDPR Representative at GDPR AV Services UG (haftungsbeschränkt/limited liability), Fraunhoferstraße 8a, 48161 Münster, Germany, viedge@gdprav.com.
6. What Choices Do I Have?

Password

We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84 require certain businesses to respond to requests from California consumers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy, as we do, only to disclose Personal Information of consumers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the consumer has not opted out of such information-sharing or has opted out and subsequently opted back in.
7. EU Privacy Shield
We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union to the United States. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
We comply with the Privacy Shield’s Principle regarding accountability for onward transfers. We remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if our onward transfer recipients process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we were not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Information. We have further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU.
We are aware of the July 16, 2020 decision from the European Union Court of Justice which invalidated the EU-U.E. Privacy Shield. Nonetheless, we will continue to abide by the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the protection of personal information. We are closely monitoring developments and guidance from both European and US regulatory authorities, including the agreement in principle between the European Commission and the United States announced in March 2022 outlining a new Data Privacy Framework to replace the EU-U.E Privacy Shield (subject to certain approvals in the European Union), and will update this Privacy Policy as needed.
EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at: privacy-talkatone@ooma.com. Under certain circumstances, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about our compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has Privacy Shield investigatory and enforcement powers over us.
8. How long do we store your data?
When determining the retention period of your Personal Information, we take into account various criteria, including but not limited to the type of Services provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods provided by law.
9. Canada Privacy Rights
If you are located in Canada, you have additional rights as described in this section. Upon request, you have the right to be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information and shall be given access to that information, subject to certain exceptions.

Last updated: November 30, 2023
Introduction
This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us.
The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law.
Definitions
First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity.
Personal data: “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” as the GDPR says. This includes data such as your IP address, device IDs, advertising IDs, and location. Below where we describe how we process personal data, we also list the specific purpose for doing so, as well as our legal basis under the GDPR (as those terms are defined below).
Data controller: The person or company that decides whether and how to process personal data.
Data processor: Someone who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller.
Legal basis: the specific legal grounds we use for processing personal data. The GDPR sets out six specific grounds for processing personal data. The ones most relevant to our Applications are as follows:
Consent: When we process personal data based on your consent, that means you’ve expressly given us permission to do so.
Contractual grounds: When we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract, for example to provide you with a service as described in our Terms of Service or some other agreement.
Legitimate interest: When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy.
Legal compliance: In some instances it is necessary for us to process personal data in order to fulfill other obligations under the law, for example detecting fraud, making sure you are who you say you are, etc.
Applications: the specific apps we offer, as mentioned below, including our desktop and mobile browsers.
Monetization: making money. Nearly all of our Applications are free to download and use. Therefore we monetize our products in various ways, mostly by selling advertising within the Applications themselves. The money we make helps us keep the lights on, pay the salaries of our staff, and continue developing the most innovative, independent browsers on the market. However, when we monetize our Applications, we never sell our users’ personal data to anyone.
Purpose: the specific reason or reasons we have for processing personal data.
Process or processing: collecting or using personal data. As defined in the GDPR, the word “processing” can mean doing almost anything with personal data. Below we have used it in this general sense when we have a general meaning in mind, and used more specific terms (like “store” or “share”) where appropriate.
Retention / retain: the time period for which we will continue to store data. In general, we do not process or store personal data longer than needed and therefore delete it after a certain period of time. Below we have included some more specific details on retention periods, which vary depending on the type of personal data at issue and the purpose for which it is processed.
Transfer: Personal data is “transferred” when it is sent or made permanently available to someone or some company outside the European Economic Area (or EEA - that is the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Opera Group: Our affiliated group of companies, including Opera Norway AS (a Norwegian company) which develops and publishes the Opera browsers, as well as other subsidiaries and affiliated companies around the world. For more information, see below.
Applications
The kinds of data (including personal data) that we process vary a great deal depending on which applications you use. You can read more about how each of our products processes data below.
Desktop Browsers
Desktop Browsers The following sections describe how we process data (including, but not limited to personal data) in our desktop applications – Opera browser for Computers (on Windows, Mac, and Linux), Opera GX desktop (on Windows and Mac), and our desktop Crypto Browser (on Windows and Mac). Opera Account None of our browsers require that you sign in before you can start using them. However, you have the option to create an Opera account to use certain services (like commenting on our Forum or blogs, VPN Pro, Loomi, Cashback, etc.). Again, you do not have to create an Opera account to use our browser applications for regular browsing activities, such as browsing the web. If you choose to create an Opera account, we ask for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively, you can use your Google, Facebook, Twitter, or VK account to sign in to an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we may collect information such as your name, profile picture, and email address from these social networks. If you use your Opera account in conjunction with a service like VPN Pro or Cashback, the data we process in connection with those services will be associated with your Opera account. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you choose to change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for two years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after six months of inactivity. Note also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them. The synced data is retained until your Opera account is deleted. Purpose: to allow you to access certain services. Legal basis: Contractual grounds (e.g., providing you the services). Personalized Content Our browsers may include personalized content features, such as a native newsfeed, or specialty content features such as Shopping Corner. When you interact with these features, we collect some information, such as the articles you read in the newsfeed, and your general location. We use this information to build a profile of your interests, which we use to select more relevant content for you. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to withdraw your consent, you can go to the settings menu and disable personalized content. Purpose: Providing a more personalized experience and encouraging user engagement; monetization. Legal Basis: Consent. Browser Extensions You can install browser extensions or add-ons, which can be downloaded from the Opera add-ons website. Most of these extensions are developed by third parties and are subject to their own privacy terms. Please carefully review the terms before installing extensions. Please note that, as described in our Terms of Service, the sidebar messaging services (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.) offered within Opera are provided by third parties. These services will not collect any data from you through the side-bar tool unless you specifically sign into them and use them. Opera does not collect any data when you use these services. Free VPN When you use our free, built-in browser VPN service, we do not log any personal data or other information related to your browsing activity or originating network address. As long as the browser VPN is active, all traffic in the browser is encrypted using strong industry standard encryption. VPN Pro Depending on where you live, you may be able to purchase a paid, premium VPN service called VPN Pro. VPN Pro is provided by a third-party service provider which owns, operates, and maintains the infrastructure which provides the Service. Data communicated through VPN Pro will be encrypted and routed through one of thousands of servers around the world. However, we do not promise that the service is absolutely secure. Despite our best efforts and the best efforts of our provider, criminals or other bad actors may still be able to access your data.
VPN Pro is a no-log service. We do not collect or store records of web pages you visit or links you click on in the servers dedicated for this Service.
To use VPN Pro you need to create and sign in to an Opera account. We use your Opera account to identify you as a valid subscriber to the VPN Pro service. We will share only information required to identify you as a subscriber with our third-party service provider, including a random ID number. We do not share your email, name, or other data or personal data with our third-party service provider. Purpose: To provide the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds. AI Chat Depending on which version of the browser you are using, you may be able to access an AI-powered chat assistant (‘AI Chat’). AI Chat is powered by OpenAI and Google (both US-based companies). To access AI Chat, you will need to sign into your Opera Account. We do not share your Opera Account data with anyone, including OpenAI or Google. For more information on how we use and retain Opera Account data, see the section on Opera Account above. Your input (all data that you choose to provide to AI Chat, including any personal data) is shared with OpenAI in order to provide you with responses. AI Chat also automatically processes your input to give you more precise or meaningful responses. Moreover, based on your inputs, AI Chat identifies prompts that are shared with Google for the purpose of generating Google Search Suggestions to enrich the response you receive from AI Chat. We will ask you for your consent for such data processing when you use AI Chat for the first time. After your session is complete, your chats will be stored locally on your device and on Opera servers but will not be retained by OpenAI. After 30 days your chats data will be automatically removed from Opera’s servers but will still be available on your device. At any time you can delete your chats (both stored locally and on Opera servers), by going to the chats list by clicking the chat bubble icon on the top bar of the chat. There you can either delete them one at a time by swiping, or you can select multiple chats and delete them all at once by clicking the bin icon. You may also opt - out from Google search suggestions feature via AI Chat Settings. Purpose: To provide and manage the service Legal basis: Legitimate interest (for Opera Account data), Consent (for any data you input to AI Chat) Cashback Cashback is an incentive program where you can earn rewards when purchasing goods or services from participating online merchants. When you choose to use the Cashback program and visit supported websites, we will collect merchant URLs, a list of your purchased items, transaction amounts, and IP address. This data is required for the Cashback service to function, and we also use it to provide more relevant partner deals, and to detect fraud and misuse of the service. To enable payouts, your Opera account will be linked with a payment service provider, which will share your customer ID, and relevant payment related data with Opera. Your payment data may be stored for up to five years due to regulatory requirements. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. Your Cashback data will be automatically deleted after two years of inactivity. You may delete your Cashback account, which will erase your personal data from the system, through the Account Setting menus in Cashback account. Purpose: To provide and improve the service. Legal basis: Contractual grounds, legal compliance. GX Gaming Servers Depending on where you live, the GX Gaming Servers service may allow you to purchase a license to access servers optimized for online gaming (the “GX Gaming Servers”). To use GX Gaming Servers you need to create and sign in to an Opera account. We use your Opera account to identify you as a valid subscriber to the GX Gaming Servers service. We will only share information required to identify you as a subscriber with: GTX Network Limited, our third-party service provider - a random ID number;
payments provider - e-mail, unique ID tracking number, country. GTX Network Limited may process additional data, including your name, address, email address, and phone number. Processing by GTX Network Limited is subject to their Terms and conditions and Privacy Policy. Data you upload to the GX Gaming Service will be stored on the GTX Network Limited servers while you continue to use the GX Gaming Service and for 2 months afterward. GTX Network Limited will store the additional data as above for 12 months. GTX Network Limited maintains servers around the world, including Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. If you choose one of those locations your data will obviously be stored there. Purpose: To provide the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds GX Cloud GX Cloud is a set of online services, and a community for gamers, consisting of the following websites: GX Games, GX Store, GX Create, and GX Me, which give you access to games and other content and the option to play, compete in, and create video games, mods, and other. You do not need an account to play most games; however, to get access to certain content (including paid content), participate in challenges, or to create content, you need an Opera account. After signing up for the first time, you will be prompted to provide your date of birth and an optional avatar. We use your date of birth to ensure you are eligible to use the service. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. Purpose: To provide the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds. My Flow If you use the “My Flow” function, a random ID is generated by the Flow server and assigned to each client device. These IDs are used solely to enable pairing functionality between Opera desktop and mobile applications and persist only while your devices are connected to My Flow. Your data is protected with end-to-end encryption and we retain it only as long as you continue to use the feature. You can disconnect your devices from My Flow, and delete your data through the application’s Settings menu. Crypto Wallet Depending on your location, some Opera browsers may allow you to access a non-custodial crypto “wallet” offered by our affiliate, Blueboard Limited (an Opera Group company). Blueboard is the data controller for this feature, and you can read their privacy statement here. Opera does not act as a data controller for this feature, but may process some data in order to help the wallet to function in our apps. SaviSwap SaviSwap is a free to use smart contract Service, provided by Opera, that finds and chooses for you the best available swap. If you use SaviSwap, Opera may collect the following data: your public wallet transaction history, asset balance, and public wallet addresses directly via our backend services which collect data directly from the blockchain or use 3rd party services (like for NFTs), which themselves gather data from the blockchain. We may share those data with swap providers to find the best swap for you. We store the data in the user’s local storage (a feature that is available natively in each browser) for caching purposes. Usage Statistics When you install an Opera application, a random installation ID is generated. We collect this identifier, as well as Machine ID, hardware specifications (model, release date, etc.), operating system, environment configuration, and feature usage data to improve our products and services. For example, we may use it to analyze how our users interact with our applications, or to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, or to detect and debug problems. We have no practical way of using this information to identify you personally. We retain this usage data for up to three years. You can opt out of reporting extended statistics through the settings menu and choosing not to “Help Opera”. Purpose: Improving our products. Legal basis: Legitimate interest (debugging and improving products and services). Crash Reports and Logs If an Opera application crashes, we collect a log that includes some information about your browser’s version, your operating system, platform and some memory data related to the crash. We collect this data with the sole purpose of improving our products and services. Crash logs are kept for up to five months. You can opt out of reporting this data to us through the settings menu of the browser. If you visit our websites, we may collect your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. We use IP addresses of website visitors solely for this purpose and may keep these website access logs up to six months. Browser Assistant Opera for computers on Windows includes a component called Browser Assistant that displays notifications promoting the browser’s features or the browser itself. Browser Assistant checks if any notifications are pending on a scheduled basis and may report occurrences of certain system events (such as low battery, low hard disk space, new Wi-Fi network connected, another browser installed). Browser Assistant collects this data, as well as a randomly generated Opera ID so that we can determine and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the notifications that we display to users. We may retain this data for up to four years. You can opt out of this data collection via your browser settings by selecting not to help improve Opera. Purpose: Improving our products. Legal basis: Legitimate interest (improving our products by understanding effectiveness of notifications of users) . Malicious-site Check We use a fraud prevention framework (including Google Safe Browsing) to check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We do not process any personal data in this context. Search Providers Opera browsers allow you to customize the search engine used in the browser address bar. In most cases Google is the default provider, but other providers (such as Bing) might be set as default based on which version of the Application you are using. You can always change your default provider in the settings menu. Opera does not share personal data with search engine providers to enable search within Opera browsers. Just like any other third-party website you might access, use of any search engine is subject to the terms of service and privacy policy offered by the specific search engine provider. Some of the web search services available in the Application may be provided by partners of CodeFuel Ltd. including, for example, bing.com. For information on the web search services data collection, please visit the search provider’s privacy policy. Personalized Ads & Profiling Based on data such as IP address, hashed user ID, and your general location, some of our Applications serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings. As noted in our End User License Agreements and Terms of Service, our applications are generally provided for free and as such are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user. We may also combine this data with other elements – including categories of websites you search and visit, device information (model, release date, device IDs, hardware specifications, operating system, etc.), and categories of ads you have clicked on in our products - to build a better understanding of what our users are interested in. We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to view your options, or to withdraw your consent, please visit the settings menu of the application you are using. Purpose: Improving our products and services, monetization. Legal Basis: Consent. Speed Dials Our browsers include visual bookmarks on the home screen which we call Speed Dials. You can customize the Speed Dials through the Application’s settings menu. Some Speed Dials are ads provided by our advertising partners. If you choose to use Opera’s default Speed Dials, you may be redirected through Opera’s partners or other third parties. These partners and third parties may collect data from you independently of Opera. This data may include third party cookies, device IDs, and session statistics. If you wish to opt out of such data collection, you can easily configure your browser’s Cookie Settings to reject third party cookies. You may also choose not to receive Speed Dial suggestions, or to adjust your Speed Dials by deleting preset options based on your own preference. Web3 Guard Some Opera browsers may provide you with additional Web 3 security check features. Those features are enabled by default and are visible in your address bar. You may turn off the specific features at any time in the browser settings. Dapp Check is a feature that will look for known security risks connected to decentralised applications you are exploring, such as: If the Dapp contains malicious contracts
If the Dapp has a malicious owner
Whether the Dapp has been audited
Whether Dapp’s contracts are open source If a Dapp contains malicious contracts or is owned by a known malicious creator, you will be warned prior to entering the Dapp’s website. Dapp does checks based on the URL you are visiting against a database of Dapp security information that Opera maintains internally. This database is kept within your local storage, and the check itself is run locally any time you enter a website. Because of this, the check is performed without collecting any of your personal data, and without storing any of the URLs you visit. Seed Phrase Phishing Check is a feature that checks webpages you visit for suspicious seed-phrase phishing behaviors, such as: Common phishing keywords: the private key, seed phrase, mnemonic phrase, etc.
Common phishing properties: input box, list of wallet options to connect with
Certain sizes, numbers, and positions of text input components
Files and documents that include phishing patterns When a risk is detected, a message is displayed to warn you against engaging in risky interactions with a suspected phishing site. Seed Phrase Phishing Check monitors the DOM (document object model), a piece of the interfacing layer of the actual web page, and screens for any phishing patterns. So the check does not listen to or watch the actual content of your browsing, and does not collect, process, or share any of your browsing data or personal data. Promotion & Marketing We process some data in order to promote and market our products and services. Some of this data comes directly from you when you submit it to us for some specific purpose. For example, if you decide to provide feedback to Opera, or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email, or postal address. Depending on the nature of the campaign or contest, it may be necessary to share your data with third parties. When that applies, we will make it clear in the terms applicable to the campaign. If you agree to receive marketing information from Opera via email, SMS, or push notifications, we may use third-party technology providers to deliver such messages to you. You can opt-out from marketing communication at any time in your Opera account profile settings or directly from a marketing email you received. If you submit your phone number or email address on an application download page, we may send you a download link via SMS or email for your convenience. In Opera for Windows computers, we may use the Browser Assistant component to promote the browser and its features to you. Browser Assistant comes as part of the Opera Browser for Windows, and may be manually removed from the system’s startup list, or via the browser settings. To learn more about Browser Assistant, please read our dedicated section on it in this statement. In general when we process data in the context of a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, we process your personal data on the basis that doing so is necessary to enable you to participate in the campaign. In some cases we process data for marketing purposes based on your consent. In any case we will not retain your data any longer than necessary to fulfill the specific purpose for which it was collected to begin with. You can always control your preferences via the settings menu or through your account, and if you have other concerns you can reach out to us through this form. Purpose: To promote our products and services. Legal Basis: Varies by context as explained above - may include contractual grounds, legitimate interest, or consent (in some cases). Third Party Technologies Our applications and services include third-party technology or code, some of which may use your data in different ways. When such third-party technologies use previously collected data, they typically act as data processors for us. When they collect data on their own, they typically act as independent data controllers. For convenience, we have included links to their privacy policies below. Data controllers are marked with an asterisk. Third-party features: Google Geolocation API (Windows only)* Google Safe Browsing Google Ads

In any case we will not retain your data any longer than necessary to fulfill the specific purpose for which it was processed to begin with. You can always control your preferences via the settings menu, and if you have other concerns you can reach us through this form. Cashback Cashback is an incentive program where you can earn rewards when purchasing goods or services from participating online merchants. When you choose to use the Cashback program and visit supported websites, we will collect merchant URLs, a list of your purchased items, transaction amounts, and IP address. This data is required for the Cashback service to function, and we also use it to provide more relevant partner deals, and to detect fraud and misuse of the service. To enable payouts, your Opera account will be linked with a payment service provider, which will share your customer ID, and relevant payment related data with Opera. Your payment data may be stored for up to five years due to regulatory requirements. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. Your Cashback data will be automatically deleted after two years of inactivity. You may choose to delete your Cashback account, which will erase your personal data from the system, through the Account Setting menus in Cashback account. Purpose: To provide and improve the service. Legal basis: Contractual grounds, legal compliance. Opera Account None of our browsers or websites require that you sign-in before you can start using them. However, you have the option to create an Opera account to use certain services (like our blogs, VPN Pro, Loomi, or Cashback, etc.). Again, you do not have to create an Opera account to use our browser applications for regular browsing activities, such as browsing the web. If you choose to create an Opera account, we may for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively, you can use your Facebook, Twitter, or VK account to sign in into an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we collect information such as your name, profile picture, and email address from these social networks. If you use your Opera account in conjunction with a service like VPN Pro or Cashback, whatever data we process in connection with those services will be associated with your Opera account. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for two years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after six months of inactivity. Note also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them. The servers we use for this service do not retain this data. Purpose: to allow you to access certain services. Legal basis: Contractual grounds. AI Chat Depending on which version of the browser you are using, you may be able to access an AI-powered chat assistant (‘AI Chat’). AI Chat is powered by OpenAI and Google (both US-based companies). To access AI Chat, you will need to sign into your Opera Account. We do not share your Opera Account data with anyone, including OpenAI or Google. For more information on how we use and retain Opera Account data, see the section on Opera Account above. Your input (all data that you choose to provide to AI Chat, including any personal data) is shared with OpenAI in order to provide you with responses. AI Chat also automatically processes your input to give you more precise or meaningful responses. Moreover, based on your inputs, AI Chat identifies prompts that are shared with Google for the purpose of generating Google Search Suggestions to enrich the response you receive from AI Chat. We will ask you for your consent for such data processing when you use AI Chat for the first time. After your session is complete, your chats will be stored locally on your device and on Opera servers but will not be retained by OpenAI. After 30 days your chats data will be automatically removed from Opera’s servers but will still be available on your device. At any time you can delete your chats (both stored locally and on Opera servers), by going to the chats list by clicking the chat bubble icon on the top bar of the chat. There you can either delete them one at a time by swiping, or you can select multiple chats and delete them all at once by clicking the bin icon. You may also opt - out from Google search suggestions feature via AI Chat Settings. Purpose: To provide and manage the service Legal basis: Contractual grounds (for Opera Account data), Consent (for any data you input to AI Chat) Loomi by Opera Depending on where you live, you may be able to access the Loomi Service to stream or download movies and other content from within the browser or via the Loomi.tv website. If you use the Loomi Service, Opera will collect the following data: Opera account data. Using Loomi requires creating an Opera account. We use your Opera account data to provide and administer the Loomi Service, for example to determine your default language, to list titles you have watched and payments you have made, and to inform you about changes to the Service. We retain this data for as long as your Opera account is active (as described above). Purpose: To provide you the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds.
Content-related data. We collect data, such as the titles you have viewed, titles you have rented, and where you have left off in a movie, in order to manage your account and so that you can resume viewing at a later time. We also collect additional data, such as your IP address and a unique, randomly-assigned internal identification number, in order to comply with certain legal and/or contractual obligations, such as ensuring that you are located in a territory covered by the applicable content license, and detecting abusive or illegal use of the Loomi Service. Information about titles and views is associated with your Opera account and will be retained for as long as your account is active, however your payment data may be stored for up to five years due to regulatory requirements. Purpose: To provide you the service; to understand our users and improve the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds, legal compliance.

General Topics
Data Controller & Internal Processing
Opera browsers are developed and published by Opera Norway AS, a company registered under the laws of Norway. Therefore Opera Norway AS acts as the primary data controller for Opera browsers and services.
The Opera Group companies work together to develop our apps, and to market, distribute, and monetize them around the world. In general, the other companies of the Opera Group that may have access to personal data act as data processors for Opera Norway. As a matter of company policy, we apply the GDPR to our internal processing in general, even in contexts where it might not apply directly to our affiliated companies outside of Europe.
Use of Cookies
We use cookies on our websites for session management and retaining your settings or preferences. We may also use third-party cookies to collect visitor statistics and measure our marketing campaigns. If you would like to reject third-party cookies, please configure your browser’s settings accordingly. Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more information.
Children’s Privacy
There are no guarantees that children cannot enter our websites or use our applications without parental consent or notification. Therefore, and as provided in our End User License Agreements, we require children to include their parents in the download process, and we encourage parents to read this privacy statement before allowing their children to use our applications and services.
International Data Transfers
As noted above, in different contexts we may share or make available data (including personal data) with other members of the Opera Group, and sometimes with third parties, such as our marketing and monetization partners. Where applicable, we insist that a legally valid mechanism is used to protect such transfer, including for example the European Union’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (also known as the “standard contractual clauses”) to ensure adequate protection of your personal data.
You have the right to make a request to access or delete any of your personal data that we might possess. You can make a request via this online request form or by contacting our Data Protection Officer at the address below. You may be required to provide additional information to authenticate your request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with Datatilsynet, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, which can be contacted through their webpage.
When we post changes to this privacy statement, we will include the date when the statement was last updated. If we significantly change this statement, we will notify you about the upcoming change via our website or using in-app notifications. We encourage you to review this statement periodically.
If you have any questions about this statement or any privacy issues in our applications or services, feel free to contact our Data Protection Officer via this online request form or by post:",
130,com.brave.browser,"Brave Private Web Browser, VPN",Communication,Brave Software,100M+,https://brave.com/privacy/,"Our company does not store any record of people’s browsing history. We don’t write any personal data to the blockchain. The only way a user’s data is stored by Brave is if the user has switched on Rewards or Sync.
Read this document to understand how the Brave Browser uses data.
To learn how we use data to operate our websites, forums, and communications, visit the Website Privacy Policy. To learn how we use data for publishers and creators visit the Publisher Privacy Policy on the Basic Attention Token website.
In this policy “we”, “us”, etc. refers to Brave Software Inc, while “Brave” refers to the browser.
Brave automatically checks with us for updates. This ensures that you always have access to the latest security fixes. We count the number and type of these requests when we receive them to produce aggregate statistics. No particular person’s information can be identified in the statistics we produce.
You can also update to the latest version here.
Safe Browsing
The Brave Browser automatically uses Google Safe Browsing to help protect you against websites, downloads and extensions that are known to be unsafe (such as sites that are fraudulent or that host malware). On desktop, we use the Safe Browsing Update API which relies on storing URL hashes locally on your device. We proxy these requests through Brave’s servers to reduce the amount of information sent to Google (for example, we remove your IP address) to protect against Google profiling or tracking you when using Safe Browsing. On iOS, Apple proxies Google Safe Browsing through their own servers. For iOS users in mainland China, Apple may also use the Tencent Safe Browsing service. More details at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/safari/. On Android, we use the SafetyNet Safe Browsing API which sends partial URL hashes directly to Google when a URL is determined to be potentially malicious by the list stored locally on your device, as per the Safe Browsing Update API.
If you prefer not to use Safe Browsing, just visit brave://settings/security to change your settings to “No protection (not recommended)”. On iOS, open “Brave Shields & Privacy” inside settings and disable “Block Dangerous Sites”. On Android, open “Brave Shields & privacy” inside settings and then set the Safe Browsing option to “No protection (not recommended)”.
Sync
If you switch on Sync then your bookmarks (and soon passwords and other data) will be saved in an encrypted file on a cloud storage service, to which you will have the only decryption key. The data are entirely inaccessible to Brave and to the cloud storage provider. Learn how to switch on Sync here. (Note that only Brave version 0.59 and above have the Sync feature. You can update to the latest version here.)
Location
If you use Brave to visit a website that wants to determine your location, you will be asked whether you want it to be allowed to know where you are. If you click yes to this message, then the website will be sent an approximation of where you are based on your IP address. Your IP address will not be stored by Brave, but it may be stored by the website you have visited. See data processing detail.
Brave Rewards
If you enable Brave Rewards, we assign your Brave browser a “Rewards Payment ID,” which is used to account for Basic Attention Token (BAT) rewards you may earn for seeing Brave Private Ads. We will also ask you to select your country, which we will use to assign a country code to your Rewards Payment ID. The country code helps us ensure Ads are displayed to individuals depending on their country. We will also use the country code to help us prevent fraud. You can find your Rewards Payment ID by navigating to brave://rewards-internals.
If you want to withdraw any BAT from your Brave Rewards balance, add BAT to it, or send on-demand contributions to Brave Creators, you will need to link Brave Rewards to a custodial account using one of our custodial partners such as Uphold, Gemini, bitFlyer (Japan only), or ZebPay (India only). When you make an on-demand contribution to Brave Creators using BAT from your linked custodial account(s), the custodian can see and record the details of your contribution transactions (such as, but not limited to, the amount and the recipient). This is subject to the privacy policies of Uphold, Gemini, bitFlyer, or ZebPay. However, when using the Auto-Contribute feature to support Brave creators with BAT from your custodial account, neither Brave nor your custodian can tell which specific creators you’re contributing to.
Even with Brave Rewards enabled and a Rewards Payment ID assigned, we never collect your browsing history or similar information, and we can’t derive this information from your contributions to content creators or sites. We also cannot tell which specific Brave Private Ads you’ve seen or interacted with. When you link a custodial account to Brave Rewards, three things become associated with your Rewards Payment ID: a custodian ID, deposit address(es), and a country code. All three are assigned by the custodial partner. The deposit address allows us to make deposits to your custodial account, while the country code helps us prevent fraud and limit service to users in countries where Brave Rewards is supported. In addition, we also use IP addresses and Rewards Payment IDs associated with monthly BAT payments to safeguard against fraud. See Brave Rewards data processing table
We record these identifiers on servers located in the United States. We take a range of technical and organisational measures to safeguard personal data.
Ads
If you switch on Brave Rewards we automatically enable Brave Ads. This means you will receive ads in the form of notifications and in-browser sponsored content, and Basic Attention Tokens to reward you for viewing those ads. While the categories of ads that you see and when you see them are inferred from your browsing activity, the data are stored on your device and are inaccessible to us. We will receive anonymized confirmations for ads that you have viewed, but no data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as an individual leaves the Brave browser on your device. You can disable Ads by visiting Settings > Brave Rewards > Ads and turning off the Ads default.
In the cases where we collect high-level statistics relating to web activity data (e.g. what are the estimated amount of ads that can be served to different content categories that users encounter as they browse the web) we use proven privacy mechanisms like local differential privacy that guarantee that no information about individual users will ever be revealed to us. Read more about how we achieve this with Privacy Preserving Product Analytics and Private Advertising Analytics. To read more about Brave Ads and privacy have a look at our FAQ.
Brave Wallet
The Brave Wallet is a secure crypto wallet built directly into the Brave browser. You can buy, send, store, and swap thousands of assets (and NFTs) seamlessly on 100+ blockchain networks including Ethereum, Solana, Filecoin, and more. You can learn more about ‘crypto wallets’ and the Brave Wallet here
Brave does not track any of the actions you make in your wallet. We strive to put privacy first:
Brave proxies and strips the IP address associated with access to the Brave Wallet.
When you make a transaction using a third party that redirects you to their services, such as an on-ramp partner, they will capture your IP address and may conduct identity verification checks in order to meet obligations they have under sanctions and anti-money laundering laws. You should review the privacy notices and terms of service of those third parties.
We use Decentralised Exchange Aggregators (DEX) such as 0x for swaps made on EVM compatible blockchains and Jupiter for swaps completed on the Solana blockchain. They will also process your wallet address, related transaction data and your IP address but will ONLY use this data to fulfil the transaction (including getting a quote).
We will use anonymized and aggregated statistics from on-ramp partners that include regional volumes of transactions, including daily number of transactions by token/chain; daily $ volume of transactions by token/chain; monthly unique transactions by token/chain. We use this statistical data to understand at a high level which cryptocurrency assets are being used and on which platforms.
Brave News
Brave News is a private, ad-supported content news reader integrated into the Brave browser. It provides news content, Brave offers, display advertising, and promoted content. It is off by default.
When you turn ON Brave News, a range of content is presented by default. The default content is selected using Brave Search. You can at any time change the default content settings and choose what content you want appearing in your feed. You can also add feeds manually by subscribing directly to publishers’ content using publicly available RSS feeds.
To protect your privacy, Brave employs a combination of methods for delivering content that ensure your browser cannot be identified or tracked by Brave or any third party. Headlines are made available on a public CDN in text files, the same file for all users for each region. Some images from publishers and images in the Brave News user interface are processed to improve performance and ensure they display correctly in the Brave News user experience. Processed images are all delivered through a private and encrypted proxy method. The proxy removes and does not retain IP addresses before passing the encrypted request to the private content server, which then sends the encrypted reply back to the browser via the proxy. All other publisher images are collected directly from the publishers from your device. When you add RSS feeds manually, the text and images are collected directly from the publisher of the RSS feed and included in Brave News on the client. The feed of text and images from Brave and from your RSS feeds is temporarily stored on your device, and it is replaced upon starting or refreshing your Brave News session.
Display advertising and promoted content is delivered to all browsers within a given country that have turned on and enabled Brave News. Images from these are served by Brave using its private and encrypted proxy. If you also enable Brave Ads, advertising will be presented based on your interests, as inferred from your browsing behaviour and done on your device. Brave News remains private to you and anonymous.
Brave News will offer suggestions of sources you might like to follow. If you choose to follow a suggested source it will be added to your Following list; you can always unfollow a source via the Settings panel. The suggestions and your choices are determined on your browser and never leave your device. Your Brave News sessions are not logged or saved by Brave. This information is private to you and only you.
Brave’s source list, content aggregator and Suggestions service are open source and available to view via GitHub.
Please note: The RSS feed content you add is collected directly from the feed source and not proxied by Brave. The Brave browser fetches it without ever hitting Brave servers, and Brave never knows anything about your chosen RSS feeds.
It’s your choice. You can add, follow, unfollow, or hide content sources any time.
Brave Talk
Brave Talk is a private video and/or audio conference tool. What you say or type in the service is not logged or saved. Who you talk to, when, and how, is private to you. See data processing detail.
Please note that Brave uses the 8x8 communications platform, and software (API) capabilities of 8x8 (based on the Jitsi Open Source video conferencing software) to help deliver Brave Talk. 8x8 provides a service on behalf of Brave, and we remain responsible for Brave Talk.
What information does Brave Talk process?
We process the minimum information necessary to provide the Brave Talk service. This includes:
Your IP address and the URL of the meeting that will be processed only to enable calls; they are not retained after a call ends.
If you use the chat function, chats will be temporarily cached for the duration of the meeting.
If you record a meeting that you host, the recording will be temporarily stored on the server for 24 hours to allow you to download it. Your name and email address that you choose to display will be processed and available during the meeting.
While communications are encrypted between the Brave browser and Brave Talk servers via transport layer encryption, they are not encrypted on the server during a call, unless you enable Video Bridge Encryption (VBE). Additional security options are available to you in the settings menu once you initiate a call. These include:
Enable Lobby : This lets you protect your meeting by only allowing people to enter after being approved by a moderator.
: This lets you protect your meeting by only allowing people to enter after being approved by a moderator. Add a passcode : This lets you restrict access to the meeting to people who have been provided the code.
: This lets you restrict access to the meeting to people who have been provided the code. Enable Video Bridge Encryption (VBE): This is currently experimental. If you enable VBE, it will disable server side services such as recording, live streaming, and phone participation. Note that if you enable VBE but other participants do not, they won’t be able to see or hear you.
Please note that if you upgrade to the Brave Talk Premium plan, Brave will require an email address to initially create a premium account, and subsequently to manage your access to the account using anonymous credentials. We use the third-party payment provider Stripe to process payments for premium subscriptions. Stripe will process your email address, name, and payment card data for the purpose of managing your subscription payments only. Brave does not receive nor have access to your payment method details supplied to Stripe, and we cannot associate an account email address or payment details with your communications on Brave Talk.
Web3 calls are a special feature of Brave Talk. They use Web3 services as a gating mechanism to a call, so that only people who can prove ownership of a particular NFT can join a video call.
For each new Web3 Brave Talk call the service will look up NFT addresses that match users’ Brave Wallet addresses, via a service called Simplehash. The address lookup is handled via an anonymous proxy, which means Brave servers never record the addresses and have no visibility of members of a call.
Web3 calls use the same infrastructure as non-Web3 Brave Talk calls. However, the use of NFTs and POAPs (which are publicly available on blockchains) makes the members of Web3 calls anonymous but not private.
Learn more about Web3 Calls
To avoid scams: For the avoidance of phishing attacks, note that we at Brave will never contact Brave Browser users in a Brave Talk call.
We do not authenticate users or their associated avatar images. Accordingly, you should never share any confidential information with anyone on Brave Talk unless you are certain that you know who you are talking to. (Of course, this is a good practice regardless of whether you are using Brave Talk, or email, or any other form of communication.)
Brave Translate
Brave removes IP addresses associated with requests submitted to the translation service. Additionally, any text submitted is not retained after the request completes. We do this to protect your privacy.
Brave Firewall + VPN
You can subscribe to the Brave Firewall + VPN via the applicable iOS App Store and Google Play Store. The Firewall + VPN is powered by the Guardian and who also provide technical support to Brave. See data processing detail.
Web Discovery Project
The Web Discovery Project is intended to make Brave Search more relevant and useful for everyone. If you opt in, you’ll contribute some anonymous data about searches and web page visits made within the Brave Browser (including pages arrived at via some, but not all, other search engines). This data helps build the Brave Search independent index, and ensure we show relevant results to your search queries and support more relevant experiences with Brave products and services.
Collection is done in a privacy preserving fashion. By default, the Web Discovery Project discards search queries that are too long or suspicious looking (e.g. those that include phone numbers). It also discards odd URLs (e.g. those containing hashes), URLs of pages with a no-index flag, and pages that are not public or require any sort of authentication.
The system is designed so that no data received can be linked back to individuals or their devices. For a URL to be sent it needs to be visited independently by a large number of people. All data received is unlinkable, making it impossible to build profiles or sessions of Web Discovery Project contributors.
Read a full description of the Web Discovery Project methodology.
How we improve Brave
Diagnostic reports
When Brave crashes or freezes, it creates a report that can be sent to us to help us diagnose and fix whatever caused the problem. This report contains technical information about your computer system and the event causing the problem. The data can’t be used to identify you.
We use a service called Backtrace.io to store the reports. You can choose whether to send us these reports. Even if you have chosen to send reports in the past, you can turn off future reports in settings.
Privacy Preserving Product Analytics
The Browser sends us anonymous reports to alert us to product problems and necessary improvements. None of the information it reports harms your privacy. The report only describes general use of the Browser, such as a general range of how many extensions are installed, a general range of how many tabs are open, and whether features like Shields, Rewards, and Ads are switched on. See the full list of questions here. These reports are stripped of metadata, and aggregated with measurements reported by many other instances of Brave. The data are not personal, and cannot be combined to identify you. You can deactivate Privacy-Preserving Product Analytics in Settings.
Brave Leo
The Leo AI chat feature provides summaries of the webpage you’re browsing via a chat interface that allows you to submit questions and receive responses about the content of that page. You can also ask Brave Leo questions in general and enable automatic suggested questions. The accuracy of summaries and responses to questions is not guaranteed and may include inaccurate, misleading, and/or false information. You should not submit sensitive or private information in Leo, and should exercise caution with any text related to health, finance, personal safety, or similar cases.
Brave Leo is powered by different AI models which you can select, including a self-hosted implementation of the open-source model, Llama-2. The questions you ask will be transmitted to Brave’s servers, but we do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers. If you enable automatic suggested questions, the page contents of your navigations will be sent to Leo to generate these suggestions while Leo is open. You can disable it later in Settings.
Brave Leo can also be powered by Anthropic’s Claude Instant model. If you select this model and submit personal data in Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted. Anthropic acts on our behalf as a data processor for any personal data submitted, but does not use any personal data for its own purposes or to train its AI model. Anthropic are also not allowed to share query inputs and outputs, or link them to Brave.
The legal basis relied on to process any personal data submitted is that it is necessary for the legitimate interests of Brave and end users.
Your feedback
By submitting a web compatibility report, you have the option to include certain details to assist us in analyzing and addressing compatibility issues effectively. These details may include your contact information (which is optional), language settings, the address of the website experiencing compatibility concerns, your browser version number, Shields settings, and VPN status. It is important to note that providing this information is entirely voluntary. Submitted data will be deleted from Brave servers after 30 days.
Any personally identifiable information (PII) you provide, such as your contact details, will be handled with strict confidentiality. We do not sell, trade, or transfer your information to any third parties.
We collect this data solely for the purpose of improving our services, enhancing your browsing experience, and resolving compatibility issues.
If you write feedback for Brave, we will use this to improve the product. See data processing detail.
Nightly, Dev, and Beta browser versions
Nightly, Dev, and Beta versions of the Brave Browser are experimental previews of new Brave Browser versions. They allow us to test new features so that we can find and fix errors before releasing a new version of the Brave Browser. These test versions of the Browser may automatically send crash reports to Brave so that we can identify and fix problems. A crash report can contain personal information. See data processing details.
How to switch this feature off. You can switch off “Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Brave Software” in settings.
Tip: you can quickly access settings by copying brave://settings into your address bar.
These incomplete versions of Brave represent unfinished and untested work on future versions of Brave, and their incomplete behaviour may not be adequately described by this policy. More information about the safety & reliability of pre-release versions of Brave can be found in our development documentation.

Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below. We set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, such as where the request involves substantial volumes of information or is otherwise complex). To exercise any of your rights, please complete the request form and follow the steps for submission. Access & Correction Upon request WeChat will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You also have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You also have the right to correct that information. You can access and correct your personal information by logging into your WeChat account at any time. For example, you can delete certain Location Data that you have provided us via your device settings or the ""Clear Location"" option within WeChat. If you believe we hold any other personal information, or you want to correct information that you are unable to correct using your account, please complete the request form here. We may not be able to provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person). With respect to correction requests, where we agree that the Personal Information is inaccurate or incomplete, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information too. Erasure You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your WeChat account and following the account deletion instructions here.

You may request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about you in the following circumstances: you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to have your Personal Information;
we obtained your consent to process the Personal Information and you withdraw that consent (and we have no other grounds for processing the Personal Information);
you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Information; or
you are or were under the age of 16 when we collected the Personal Information and we can verify your age. Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing your Personal Information (as described below) whilst we consider a request to erase your data. Please note, however, that we may retain the Personal Information if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims, freedom of expression or some other legal obligation) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase your Personal Information that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the Personal Information or providing links to the Personal Information to erase it too. Restriction of Processing to Storage Only You have a right to require us to stop processing the Personal Information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the Personal Information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too. You may request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about you where: you believe the Personal Information is not accurate (for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate);
we wish to erase the Personal Information as the processing we are doing is unlawful (but you want us to retain the Personal Information and just store it instead); or
we wish to erase the Personal Information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes (but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims). Portability You have the right to receive a copy of certain Personal Information we collect from you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., voluntarily-provided profile data, social media content posted to Moments and Time Capsule, content selected to store to Favorites) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., profile data), as described in the section ""How do we use your information"". You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party. You can exercise your right to export your data by following the instructions here. If you wish for us to transfer the Personal Information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the Personal Information or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property). Objection You may object to our use of your Personal Information if we use your information on the basis of our legitimate interests (such as when we use your personal information for your account security, such as to prevent malicious log-ins). If you object to such processing, please review and submit the form here, providing detailed reasons. To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us by following the instructions set out here. HOW WILL WE NOTIFY YOU OF CHANGES?

Transfers of data outside of the European Economic Area are governed by the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses as specified in the WeChat Privacy Policy. Any other information you disclose to the 3rd-party service (e.g. contact info) is governed by the 3rd-party service operator's Privacy Policy and WeChat does not have access to such information.

Third-Party Websites, Apps, Services and Back-Ups
Our App may contain links to other third-party websites or you may access Apps from a third-party website. We may also allow certain functionalities through third-party services. We are not responsible for the data collection by such third parties, and their privacy practices and polices shall govern your personal data processed by them.
Third parties’ websites, apps and services:
If you access our Services and App from any third-party website, service or other digital source, or access any third-party site or service from our Services and App, note that, your use and the personal data collected by such third parties or provided by you in connection therewith will be subject to such third party’s practices and we do not monitor, nor are responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.
We use the Google Maps API for some functions of the App, therefore the Google privacy policy http://www.google.com/privacy.html is incorporated herein.
Back-ups:
If you voluntarily choose to back up your Viber conversations, such back-ups are made by independent third parties and kept on your device’s service according to operating system’s (Google/ iOS) terms and policies and are no longer protected by Viber’s end-to-end encryption nor Viber has any control over it. This is also true for using Viber Desktop – where your conversations are kept on your personal computer under your security definitions.
TrueDepth APIs:
Starting the end of June 2021 we added a new face lens feature that uses camera capabilities in order to add graphic elements on the user’s face. Some lenses can make use of TrueDepth API. TrueDepth API is only active when those lenses are running. It is a very specific feature and none of the Viber lenses will be using it at the moment. Types of lenses that might use it are virtual try-on, which we don’t have. Viber does not collect any data from these sensors or ever store it anywhere. The data never leaves the user’s device (so cannot be, and is not, shared by Viber with third parties) and is only used for lens operation.

User Activity and VPN Data
Why should you care?
When using a VPN or proxy you should be concerned about what the VPN provider can see in your data, collect from it, and do to it.
When you use a VPN, all data to and from your device goes through it. If you visit a website that uses unencrypted HTTP, all of that site's data is visible to the VPN. If you visit a website that uses encrypted HTTPS, the site content is encrypted, but some information about the site might be visible to the VPN. Other apps and services on your device will also transfer data that is encrypted or unencrypted. (Note that this is distinct from the encryption that all VPNs provide. Here we're only concerned with data that is or is not encrypted inside the VPN tunnel.)
For unencrypted services, it is possible for a VPN provider to see, collect, and modify (e.g., injecting ads into) the contents of your data. For encrypted data, it is still possible for a VPN to collect metadata about sites visited or actions taken. You should also be concerned with your VPN provider sharing your data with third parties.
What does Psiphon NOT do with your data?
We DO NOT collect or store any VPN data that is not mentioned here.
We DO NOT modify the contents of your VPN data.
We DO NOT share any sensitive or user-specific data with third parties.
What kinds of user data does Psiphon collect?
We will define some categories of data to help us talk about them in the context of Psiphon.
User Activity Data
While a user's device is tunneled through Psiphon, we collect some information about how they're using it. We record what protocol Psiphon used to connect, how long the device was connected, how many bytes were transferred during the session, and some geographical and ISP information. For some domains (but very few, and only popular ones) or server IP addresses (e.g., known malware servers) that are visited, we also record how many bytes were transferred to it. (But never full URLs or anything more sensitive. And only domains of general interest, not all domains.)
The user's city, country, and ISP are derived from the user's IP address; the IP address is then immediately discarded. Users may also be asked to optionally allow access to their approximate location (accurate up to 3 km) using their device's location service (e.g., GPS).
An example of user activity data might be: At a certain time a user connected from New York City, using Comcast, and transferred 100MB from youtube.com and 300MB in total.
We consider user activity data the most sensitive category of data. We never, ever share this data with third parties. We keep user activity data for at most 90 days, and then we aggregate it and delete it. Backups of that data are kept for a reasonable amount of time.
Aggregated Data
Data is “aggregated” by taking a lot of sensitive user activity data and combining it together to form coarse statistical data that is no longer specific to a user. After aggregation, the user activity data is deleted.
An example of aggregated data might be: On a particular day, 250 people connected from New York City using Comcast, and transferred 200GB from youtube.com and 500GB in total.
Aggregated data is much less sensitive than activity data, but we still treat it as potentially sensitive and do not share it in this form.
Shareable Aggregated Data
When sharing aggregated data with third parties, we make sure that the data could not be combined with other sources to reveal user identities. For example, we do not share data for countries that only have a few Psiphon users in a day. We make sure that the data is anonymized.
We also never share domain-related information with third parties.
An example of shareable aggregated data might be: On a particular day, 500 people connected from New York City and transferred 800GB in total.
An example of data that is not shareable: On a particular day, 2 people connected from Los Angeles. Those people will be included in the stats for the entire US, but that is too few people to anonymously share city data for.
What does Psiphon do with User Activity and Aggregated Data?
Activity and aggregated statistical data are vital for us to make Psiphon work best. It allows us to do things like:
Monitor the health and success of the Psiphon network: We need to know how many people are connecting, from where, how much data they're transferring, and if they're having any problems.
Monitor threats to our users' devices: We watch for malware infections that attempt to contact command-and-control servers.
Ensure users stay connected while foiling censors: We try to detect that a user is behaving like a real person and then reveal new Psiphon servers to them. (This is our obfuscated server list technology.)
Estimate future costs: The huge amount of user data we transfer each month is a major factor in our costs. It is vital for us to see and understand usage fluctuations.
Determine the nature of major censorship events: Sites and services often get blocked suddenly and without warning, which can lead to huge variations in regional usage of Psiphon. For example, we had up to 20x surges in usage within a day when Brazil blocked WhatsApp or Turkey blocked social media.
Understand who we need to help: Some sites and services will never get blocked anywhere, some will always be blocked in certain countries, and some will occasionally be blocked in some countries. To make sure that our users are able to communicate and learn freely, we need to understand these patterns, see who is affected, and work with partners to make sure their services work best with Psiphon.
Who does Psiphon share Aggregated Data with?
Shareable aggregated data is shared with sponsors, organizations we collaborate with, and civil society researchers. The data can be used to show such things as:
How well Psiphon is working in a particular region.
The blocking patterns in a given country, for example during political events.
That the populace of a country is determined to access the open internet.
Again, only anonymized shareable aggregated data is ever shared with third parties.
Psiphon Client Advertising Networks
We sometimes use advertisements to support our service, which may use technology such as cookies and web beacons. Our advertising partners' use of cookies enable them and their partners to serve ads based on your usage data. Any information collected through this process is handled under the terms of our advertising partners' privacy policies:
Psiphon Websites
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics on some of our websites to collect information about usage. The information collected by Google Analytics will only be used for statistical analysis related to your browsing behaviour on this specific site. The information we obtain from Google Analytics is not personally identifying, nor is it combined with information from other sources to create personally identifying information.
Google Analytics sets a permanent cookie in your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the site, but this cookie cannot be used by anyone except Google, and the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other domains.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may choose to opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser.
Storage Access Logging
We use Amazon S3 to store assets such as website files and Psiphon server discovery lists. We sometimes enable logging of downloads of these files. Analyzing these logs helps us to answer questions like ""how many users are starting but not completing the download of the server discovery list?"", ""how is the downloaded data split between website assets and server discovery?"", and ""is an attacker making a denial-of-service attempt against our websites?""
S3 bucket access logs contain IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps. These logs are stored in S3 itself, so Amazon has access to these logs. (However, Amazon already serves the files, so they can already access this information.) Psiphon developers will download the logs, aggregate and analyze the data, and then delete the logs. Raw data will be kept only long enough to aggregate it and will not be shared with third parties.
PsiCash
The PsiCash system only collects information necessary for the functioning of the system, monitoring the health of the system, and ensuring the security of the system.
The PsiCash server stores per-user information to allow for operation of the system, including:
generated user access tokens
balance
last activity timestamp
PsiCash earning history, including what actions the rewards were granted for
PsiCash spending history, including what purchases were made
Creating a PsiCash account is optional. If an account is created, account-specific information such as username, password, and email address (if provided) are stored on the server. When logged in to a Psiphon client, the username is also stored locally.
In the user's web browser, some data is stored to allow for earning rewards and making purchases. This data includes:
generated user access tokens
when a PsiCash reward is allowed to be claimed again
For monitoring system health and security, system activity data is collected and aggregated. This data includes:
user country
balance
user agent string
client version
PsiCash earning and spending details
Individual user data is never shared with third parties. Coarse aggregate statistics may be shared, but never in a form that can possibly identify users.
PsiCash server resources are stored in AWS, which means Amazon has access to the data.
my.psi.cash
Users create and manage their PsiCash accounts on the my.psi.cash website.
reCAPTCHA
my.psi.cash uses Google’s reCAPTCHA v3 (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”), which protects websites from spam and abuse by non-human users (i.e., bots). reCAPTCHA collects personal information that is required for the functioning of the technology and is subject to its own privacy policy. Use of my.psi.cash indicates acceptance of Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms.
Our use of reCAPTCHA is strictly limited to ensuring the continued functioning of my.psi.cash. reCAPTCHA technology performs an automatic analysis for each site request without requiring the user to take any additional actions. This analysis is based on interactions made by the user, and is used to mitigate bot and other malicious behaviour on our website. The data collected during analysis is forwarded to Google, where Google will use this data to determine if you are a human user. This analysis takes place in the background, and users are not advised it is taking place.
For more information about Google’s reCAPTCHA technology, please visit https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/.
Cookies
my.psi.cash only uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to carry out activities that are essential for the operation of the website. Essential cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser, and do not represent any risk to your device. You can configure your browser settings to personalize how you would like your browser to handle cookies. Disabling essential cookies will degrade the functionality of this website.
Feedback
When you choose to submit feedback through Psiphon you will have the option of including diagnostic data. We use this data to help us troubleshoot any problems you might be having and to help us keep Psiphon running smoothly. Sending this data is entirely optional. The data is encrypted before you send it, and can only be decrypted by us. The information in the data varies by platform, but it may include:
Windows:
Operating system version
Anti-virus version
How you're connected to the internet (for example, if you're using dial-up or connected via a proxy)
How much free memory your computer has
Android:
Android version
Device model
Whether your device is rooted
Email Responder
When you send an email request to our email auto-responder server, we are able to see your email address. While your email is being processed it is saved to the email server's disk, and it is deleted as soon as it is processed (usually in a few seconds). Your email address may be written to the server system logs. These logs are deleted after one week.
Our email auto-responder server is hosted in the Amazon EC2 cloud. This means that Amazon is able to see the email you send and our response to you.
For each email we receive, we store the following information:
The date and time the email request was received.
The date and time the email request was replied to.
The size of the email.
The mail server the email request came from. (The three least specific parts of the domain name. For example, ne1.example.com , but not web120113.mail.ne1.example.com .)
App Stores
Note that if you get Psiphon from an ""app store"", such as the Google Play Store or Amazon AppStore, additional statistics may be collected by that store. For example, here is a description of what the Google Play Store collects: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/139628?hl=en",
136,org.telegram.messenger,Telegram,Communication,Telegram FZ-LLC,1B+,https://telegram.org/privacy,"1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc. (“Telegram”), use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the “Services”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to Telegram, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.
1.1 Privacy Principles
Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:
We don't use your data to show you ads.
We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.
1.2. Terms of Service
This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at https://telegram.org/tos. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.
1.3. Table of Contents
This Privacy Policy explains the following:
1.4. EEA Representative
If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services. However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated a third party, European Data Protection Office (EDPO), as our representative pursuant to Article 27 of the GDPR. You can direct to EDPO any of your GDPR-related queries:
by using EDPO’s online request form at https://edpo.com/telegram-gdpr-data-request/ or
by writing to EDPO at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium.
2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data
We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.
3. What Personal Data We Use
3.1. Basic Account Data
Telegram is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.
To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.
We do not require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).
3.2. Your Email Address
When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.
From September 2022, we may ask some users to provide an email address to receive login codes via email instead of SMS (with an option to use 'Sign in With Google' / 'Sign in with Apple'). In this case, we will receive an email address which will be stored separately from the recovery email, and will only be used to send you authentication codes when you log in to your account. The login email address will be stored until it is changed or the account is deleted.
3.3. Your Messages
3.3.1. Cloud Chats
Telegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.
3.3.2. Secret Chats
Secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.
3.3.3. Media in Secret Chats
When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.
3.3.4. Public Chats
In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above). Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.
3.4. Phone Number and Contacts
Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.
We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.
Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the approximate number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.
You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.
If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG). If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code. Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.
3.5. Location Data
If you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively.
If you share your Live Location in any chat or turn on ’Make Myself Visible’ in People Nearby, Telegram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the app is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated.
3.6. Cookies
The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web. We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising. The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience. Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.
4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
4.1. Storing Data
If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands. These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space. However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram. As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers. All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.
4.2. End-to-End Encrypted Data
Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient. Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information. In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.
4.3. Retention
Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.
5. Processing Your Personal Data
5.1. Our Services
Telegram is a cloud service. We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.
5.2. Safety and Security
Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations. Telegram also has more than 700 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers. To improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc. If collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.
5.3. Spam and Abuse
To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients. If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently. You can send an appeal using @Spambot. In case of more serious violations, your account may be banned. We may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.
5.4. Cross-Device Functionality
We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.
5.5. Advanced features
We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features. For example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen. To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently. A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”). To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.
5.6. No Ads Based on User Data
Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes. Telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.
Telegram offers a tool for advertisers to promote their messages in public one-to-many channels, but these sponsored messages are based solely on the topic of the public channels in which they are shown. No user data is mined or analyzed to display ads or sponsored messages.
6. Bot Messages
6.1. Ecosystem
Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots. Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features. By performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.
6.2. How Bots Can Receive Data
You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:
By sending messages to a bot.
By using an inline bot.
By participating in a group with a bot.
By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.
By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).
6.3. What Data Bots Receive
In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).
Bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.
Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.
If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).
If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.
When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g. @gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.
Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access. If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.
6.4. Bots Are Not Maintained by Telegram
Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram. They are completely independent from us. They should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.
7. Third Party Payment Services
7.1. Payment Information
The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0. Telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world. It is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details. Neither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information. Although we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram. Please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.
7.2. Credit Card Information
When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server. Your credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers. We do not access and do not store your credit card information. When you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a token that you can reuse for future payments. It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.
7.3 Shipping Information
When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer. We can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases. We will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.
7.4. Clearing Payment Information
You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment & Shipping Info’. If you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.
7.5. Payment Disputes
Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.
8. Who Your Personal Data May Be Shared With
8.1. Other Telegram Users
Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA. Note that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.
8.2. Telegram’s Group Companies
To provide, improve and support our Services, we may share your personal data with: (1) our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands, (2) Telegraph Inc., a group member also located in the BVI; and (3) Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai. We will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data. This will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies. If you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact our EEA representative using the details in section 1.4 above.
8.3. Law Enforcement Authorities
If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. So far, this has never happened. When it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.
8.4. Translation of Chats, Channels and specific Messages at the Request of the User
Users can choose to translate a specific text message into a different language by tapping “Translate” in the action menu of the message (to enable this option, a user should first turn on Translation services in the Settings > Languages section of the Telegram application). Telegram Premium users can also optionally enable automatic live translation on any chat, group or channel.
Since Telegram may rely on a third-party, Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, for automatic translation of messages, the text of any message or set of messages that users choose to translate may be shared with Google in order to obtain their translated versions. Google will only access the data to provide a translation and will not use it for any other Google products, services, or advertising.
8.5. Transcription of Voice and Video Messages at the Request of the User
Some users can choose to convert a voice or video message to text by tapping on the Voice-to-Text icon (“->A”) displayed on eligible messages (to be able to use this option, users should subscribe to Telegram Premium in the Settings > Telegram Premium section of the Telegram application).
Since Telegram may rely on a third party, Google LLC, subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, for voice-to-text conversion, the audio data of voice and video messages that users choose to convert to text may be shared with Google in order to obtain their transcribed versions. Only audio data may be shared for this purpose (no other data, such as the user's IP address or any information about their account is shared). According to the agreement between Telegram and Google, Telegram will pay for the transcriptions on behalf of its users and Google will only access the audio data to provide a transcribed version – it will not log audio data or transcripts, and will not use the data for any other Google products, services, or advertising.
9. Your Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us
9.1. Your Rights
Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data. You have a right to: (1) request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller; (2) delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data; (3) restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data; (4) correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you; and (5) lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.
9.2. Exercising Your Rights
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly use the contact details in section 12 below.
9.3. Data Settings
You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings (using one of our mobile apps).
Sadly, if you're not OK with Telegram's modest minimum requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services. You can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.
10. Deleting data
10.1. Accounts
If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.
10.2. Messages
In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.
In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.
As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides. There is no time limit. Any party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, regardless of how many messages are retained by either of the participants.
In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. Note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.
10.3. Self-Destructing Messages
Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct. As soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.). Media with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews. The timer is triggered when they are viewed.
10.4. Account Self-Destruction
By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.
11. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page www.telegram.org/privacy.

This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we may obtain online across all of our Internet-connected Samsung devices and services (from mobile phones and tablets to TVs, home appliances, online services, and more), our retail locations, and other offline channels (collectively, our “Services”), and how we may use and disclose that information.

We may obtain certain information about you from publicly or commercially-available sources and from third parties who perform services for us. We also may obtain other information about you, your devices, and your use of the Services, in ways we describe at the time we collect the information or otherwise with your consent.
Our Services collect some data automatically when you use the Services. We may obtain information by automated means, such as through browser cookies, pixels, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. Among other purposes, these technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services, (3) tailor the Services around your preferences, (4) manage and measure the usability of the Services, (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications, and (6) otherwise enhance the Services.
Information we may collect automatically includes information about:• your device, including MAC address, IP address, log information, hardware information, IMEI number, serial number, subscription information, device settings, connections to other devices, mobile network operator, web browser characteristics, app usage information, sales code, access code, current software version, subscription information, and randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifiers, such as Personalized Service ID (or PSID), and advertising IDs, including Google Ad ID;• your use of the Services, including clickstream data, your interactions with the Services (such as the web pages you visit, search terms, and the apps, services and features you use, download, or purchase), the pages that led or refer you to the Services, how you use the Services, and dates and times of use of the Services; and• your use of third-party websites, apps and features that are connected to certain Services.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. The Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from all of the features of our Services.
In addition to the categories of information obtained by Samsung discussed above, our Services may generate data automatically when you use certain Services (e.g. Samsung’s face-clustering technology that allows the device to group together images of the same face from different photographs (“Face-Clustering Data”)), or may utilize data that you generate independently (e.g. registering biometric data such as fingerprints to unlock your device or verify you in certain Services, or when you register your wake-up command in our Bixby Voice service). All of this data remains on the device and is not transmitted to Samsung, nor does Samsung obtain or access this data. Samsung does not share this data with third parties. Face-Clustering Data will remain on your device until you clear the cache in your system settings, you reset your device to its factory setting, or you delete the photos from your device. You can delete your registered biometric data or your wake-up command from your device at any time in the applicable settings. Because Samsung does not have access to this data, Samsung cannot delete it.
Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services or help administer the Services. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

Through certain Services, both we and various third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
Our Samsung Ads service is designed to serve advertisements that are customized to users’ interests on Samsung and third-party platforms, devices, websites, and apps. Samsung Ads may deliver customized ads based on your demographic characteristics, preferences, choices, and interests by collecting certain information about your online activities as specified in this Privacy Policy. Please see the Samsung Ads Privacy Notice https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads for more information, including information on how to opt out of receiving customized ads from Samsung Ads.
Because Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests, and browsing context. These networks can track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information the ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

141,com.kiwibrowser.browser,Kiwi Browser - Fast & Quiet,Communication,Geometry OU,10M+,https://privacy.kiwibrowser.org/,"Privacy Policy of Kiwi Browser
Kiwi Browser is a product developed in Estonia by:
Geometry OU Sepapaja tn 6 15551 Tallinn Harjumaa
[email protected] Estonia
Data controller is Arnaud Granal - arnaud _at_ geometry.ee Policy summary
We are based in Europe, where privacy laws of Europe are generally considered as very good.
We do not collect the websites that you visit. What you do in the browser is your own freedom and responsibility.
We do not collect browsing data. We do not collect history data.
Our business model is transparent: (this is why we don't have to sell your data !)
We earn money by displaying ads:
On the homepage, we display news and tiles. Between the news article, we integrate Google AdMob which is connected to its partners (list available here) and connected to Google Analytics (to count the number of installations and how many times the buttons in the browser are used and the ads are shown). We do not send what you browse to advertising networks. We only display their ads. This is a very important point.
We use Google because they have access to all the big brands (Samsung, Tesla, etc), and they do a better job a negotiating than we can do as a small company.
The advertisements can be disabled by turning off the Discover feed. There are no negative consequences in your experience to do so, but your support is appreciated. This is your choice.
We earn money by partnering with search engines:
Search engines always want new users. For example, if a browser sets DuckDuckGo as a default search engine, it's rarely a coincidence, usually the people who develop the browsers get paid for this.
For example, Mozilla Firefox, is getting paid by Google for every new user that they bring to Google. Kiwi is the same, except we get paid to bring users to Microsoft Bing, Yahoo! or another search engine depending on your country.
When you enter a search query, the query is sent to the Search Engine that you have selected (Microsoft Bing or Yahoo by default, Google, DuckDuckGo, or any provider of your choice).
If you choose to use the recommended search engine by Kiwi, Kiwi may in special cases process the request and will receive money for every search query it forwards to the partner search engine (example: Microsoft Bing).
What we do with the money:
We are a small company based in Estonia, we put most of the money back in spreading the word about Kiwi (we have to spend money in advertising ourself!). We don't have offices, so everything else goes to pay developers, or third-parties who help, or provide them with assistance. Occasionally we give to universal / non-political charities, for example to protect abandoned animals. It's still small at our scale, but we believe it's a good step and that small drops can make big rivers.
At Kiwi Browser, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes the practices concerning Geometry OU through the use of the (i) websites and applications (the Kiwi Browser Products) and (ii) our Search Applications made available by means of a search box on a Kiwi Browser Product or website from which you can access our search services.

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

In contrast, we also use email or in-app messaging to respond to customer service requests from you, to provide certain transaction-related communications regarding products or services you have requested, and to communicate certain non-promotional issues regarding imo and our Service (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy). You cannot opt out of these communications without deactivating your account, and you will continue to receive these communications from us even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications from us.
Push Notifications on Mobile devices. imo may occasionally send you push notifications through our Service. You may at any time opt out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device.
Do Not Track. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers and devices. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
Interest-based advertising technologies. As noted above, you may limit advertising tracking via advertising identifiers through your mobile device’s privacy settings. The online advertising industry also provides websites through which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in the self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/, and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
7. Rights of access, rectification, erasure, and restriction
Absent exceptional circumstances, we offer you reasonable access to and control over your personal data at any time, at no charge. Please inform yourself of your rights by reviewing the list below. You may use the “Contact Us” details at the end of this Policy to exercise your rights and choices.
For those users in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), we generally consider ourselves to be the “controller” of the “personal data” we collect and process, and we do so in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, 2016/679 (GDPR).
We try to respond to all legitimate requests regarding your personal information within one month. Occasionally, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated. The timeframes described here do not apply to our response times for addressing ordinary customer service and support requests unrelated to the exercise of personal information access rights.
Although imo uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal information and to respond to their requests, there may be circumstances in which imo needs to ask you for more information in order to identify your account, and we may ask you to demonstrate your identity. If you cannot demonstrate your identity, imo may be unable to provide access. This may occur (a) when the information contains legal privilege; (b) when complying with the request would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights; (c) when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question; or (d) where the information is commercially proprietary. If imo determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, imo will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.
Request of access. You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you, as well as to inquire about the origin, recipients, and purposes of that data. There are certain exceptions to this right, however, so we may deny access to you as required by law or to protect the legal rights of others. You can request a download of your account information in the Service. To request a download, navigate to the “Request Account Info” button inside the Settings section of the Service.

If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal information, you have the right to fully or partially withdraw your consent. We attempt to comply with all reasonable and legitimate requests. As discussed above, you may modify the permissions and settings on your mobile device and the Service in order to limit access to certain information. To withdraw your consent with respect to emails and other communications from us, please notify us or follow the opt-out links available in the communications sent to you. Once we have received notice that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Withdrawal of consent to receive marketing communications will not affect the processing of personal information for the provision of our Service. However, changing the permissions and settings on your mobile device or within the Service may cause certain features of the Service to stop functioning.

For instance, if your email changes, you wish to cancel any request you have made of us, or if you become aware of inaccurate personal information about you, please contact us to update your information. You may edit your account information via the Service.
We are not responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal data that you provide to us.
8. Data Retention
We will retain your personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to provide the Service to you. As a result, data retention periods may depend upon the feature of the Service for which the data was provided. However, we cannot guarantee that other users won’t record live feeds or other information you share with them, and another user may have a copy of information even if deleted by you and us.
We also will retain and use your personal data as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to protect our assets, to provide our services, and to enforce our agreements. For example, we may collect aggregated data from your messages that is used to build language models which help us improve the Service. This data helps us to better understand our users’ interests, analyze trends, and customize the user experience.
When we no longer have a purpose for retaining your personal data, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable law and our policies.
9. Data Security
We maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent your personal information under our control from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered or disclosed during collection, storage, and processing. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure, limited-access servers behind firewalls. Access to your account, personal data, and information is restricted within our organization to those employees and trusted partners that need access to your personal information in order to correspond with you and provide the products and/or services that you requested from us. Your personal data and information is also password-protected so that only you can log in to your account. Any additional safeguards used to protect personal information will depend on the sensitivity of the personal information; the amount, distribution and format of the information; and the method of storage.
While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures used in connection with the Service cannot be circumvented. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to circumvent those measures or other safeguards in use, or access and/or use your personal information for improper purposes.
Most communications on our Service, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the standard HTTP protocol and completed forms may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP and email is not encrypted; and, while these are convenient communication mechanisms, use of these unsecure communication methods presents privacy and security risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.). Any transmission of information that you make to us or through our Service is at your own risk.
The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the Service, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential. Do not share your password with anyone else. Restricted areas of the Service include social networking, chat room, or forum features. Please ensure that, when using these features, you do not submit any personal data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.
If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice within the Service. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Service or systems that compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law.
10. International Transfer
Our company headquarters are located in California, United States. We store and process your personal data and information on servers in the United States, Asia, and other countries outside of the EU, EEA or your home country. Be aware that your personal data and information is transferred to, stored in, and processed in these third countries which may not have the same adequate level of data protection as in your home country.
However, all transfers of personal data will be performed in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. For example, we apply appropriate safeguards such as EU Standard Contractual Clauses for EU/EEA users’ personal information.
If you do not agree to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU/EEA or your home country, you must not use the Service.
While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States and other jurisdictions might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take steps to protect the security and privacy of your personal information as set forth above.
11. Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and if you are in the EU/EEA regions, 16 years of age (or the relevant age in your country where you are considered a minor), and imo does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may delete your child’s entire account, by selecting the “Delete imo account” option in your child’s imo app settings or alert us at privacy@imo.im. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the child’s account. This section supersedes any age limitations that may be listed in connection with the ratings listed in an application store.
12. Redress and Accountability
If you have any questions about our privacy practices or this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at privacy@imo.im or via the methods listed below. We will address your concerns and attempt to resolve any privacy issues in a timely manner.
13. Changes to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post the new Policy on this page and provide notice that an update has occurred by either (a) sending notice to you at the email address specified in your account, or (b) using an in-app alert or otherwise make an in-app announcement on the first time that you use the mobile application after we make the change. You are responsible for providing us with an active, up-to-date, and deliverable email address for contacting you. It also is your responsibility to carefully review this Policy from time to time so that you are aware of any changes. The date this Policy was last revised is identified at the top of this Policy. Continuing to use our Service constitutes your consent to this Policy and any changes thereof. If you do not agree to any changes of this Policy, please stop using our Service.
14. Contact Us
If you have questions or comments about this Policy, wish to access personal information we hold about you, believe the personal information we have about you is incorrect, or wish to lodge a complaint with us about how we have handled your personal information, please use the contact details below and we will do our best to assist you:

User Activity and VPN Data
Why should you care?
When using a VPN or proxy you should be concerned about what the VPN provider can see in your data, collect from it, and do to it.
When you use a VPN, all data to and from your device goes through it. If you visit a website that uses unencrypted HTTP, all of that site's data is visible to the VPN. If you visit a website that uses encrypted HTTPS, the site content is encrypted, but some information about the site might be visible to the VPN. Other apps and services on your device will also transfer data that is encrypted or unencrypted. (Note that this is distinct from the encryption that all VPNs provide. Here we're only concerned with data that is or is not encrypted inside the VPN tunnel.)
For unencrypted services, it is possible for a VPN provider to see, collect, and modify (e.g., injecting ads into) the contents of your data. For encrypted data, it is still possible for a VPN to collect metadata about sites visited or actions taken. You should also be concerned with your VPN provider sharing your data with third parties.
What does Psiphon NOT do with your data?
We DO NOT collect or store any VPN data that is not mentioned here.
We DO NOT modify the contents of your VPN data.
We DO NOT share any sensitive or user-specific data with third parties.
What kinds of user data does Psiphon collect?
We will define some categories of data to help us talk about them in the context of Psiphon.
User Activity Data
While a user's device is tunneled through Psiphon, we collect some information about how they're using it. We record what protocol Psiphon used to connect, how long the device was connected, how many bytes were transferred during the session, and some geographical and ISP information. For some domains (but very few, and only popular ones) or server IP addresses (e.g., known malware servers) that are visited, we also record how many bytes were transferred to it. (But never full URLs or anything more sensitive. And only domains of general interest, not all domains.)
The user's city, country, and ISP are derived from the user's IP address; the IP address is then immediately discarded. Users may also be asked to optionally allow access to their approximate location (accurate up to 3 km) using their device's location service (e.g., GPS).
An example of user activity data might be: At a certain time a user connected from New York City, using Comcast, and transferred 100MB from youtube.com and 300MB in total.
We consider user activity data the most sensitive category of data. We never, ever share this data with third parties. We keep user activity data for at most 90 days, and then we aggregate it and delete it. Backups of that data are kept for a reasonable amount of time.
Aggregated Data
Data is “aggregated” by taking a lot of sensitive user activity data and combining it together to form coarse statistical data that is no longer specific to a user. After aggregation, the user activity data is deleted.
An example of aggregated data might be: On a particular day, 250 people connected from New York City using Comcast, and transferred 200GB from youtube.com and 500GB in total.
Aggregated data is much less sensitive than activity data, but we still treat it as potentially sensitive and do not share it in this form.
Shareable Aggregated Data
When sharing aggregated data with third parties, we make sure that the data could not be combined with other sources to reveal user identities. For example, we do not share data for countries that only have a few Psiphon users in a day. We make sure that the data is anonymized.
We also never share domain-related information with third parties.
An example of shareable aggregated data might be: On a particular day, 500 people connected from New York City and transferred 800GB in total.
An example of data that is not shareable: On a particular day, 2 people connected from Los Angeles. Those people will be included in the stats for the entire US, but that is too few people to anonymously share city data for.
What does Psiphon do with User Activity and Aggregated Data?
Activity and aggregated statistical data are vital for us to make Psiphon work best. It allows us to do things like:
Monitor the health and success of the Psiphon network: We need to know how many people are connecting, from where, how much data they're transferring, and if they're having any problems.
Monitor threats to our users' devices: We watch for malware infections that attempt to contact command-and-control servers.
Ensure users stay connected while foiling censors: We try to detect that a user is behaving like a real person and then reveal new Psiphon servers to them. (This is our obfuscated server list technology.)
Estimate future costs: The huge amount of user data we transfer each month is a major factor in our costs. It is vital for us to see and understand usage fluctuations.
Determine the nature of major censorship events: Sites and services often get blocked suddenly and without warning, which can lead to huge variations in regional usage of Psiphon. For example, we had up to 20x surges in usage within a day when Brazil blocked WhatsApp or Turkey blocked social media.
Understand who we need to help: Some sites and services will never get blocked anywhere, some will always be blocked in certain countries, and some will occasionally be blocked in some countries. To make sure that our users are able to communicate and learn freely, we need to understand these patterns, see who is affected, and work with partners to make sure their services work best with Psiphon.
Who does Psiphon share Aggregated Data with?
Shareable aggregated data is shared with sponsors, organizations we collaborate with, and civil society researchers. The data can be used to show such things as:
How well Psiphon is working in a particular region.
The blocking patterns in a given country, for example during political events.
That the populace of a country is determined to access the open internet.
Again, only anonymized shareable aggregated data is ever shared with third parties.
Psiphon Client Advertising Networks
We sometimes use advertisements to support our service, which may use technology such as cookies and web beacons. Our advertising partners' use of cookies enable them and their partners to serve ads based on your usage data. Any information collected through this process is handled under the terms of our advertising partners' privacy policies:
Psiphon Websites
Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics on some of our websites to collect information about usage. The information collected by Google Analytics will only be used for statistical analysis related to your browsing behaviour on this specific site. The information we obtain from Google Analytics is not personally identifying, nor is it combined with information from other sources to create personally identifying information.
Google Analytics sets a permanent cookie in your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the site, but this cookie cannot be used by anyone except Google, and the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other domains.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may choose to opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser.
Storage Access Logging
We use Amazon S3 to store assets such as website files and Psiphon server discovery lists. We sometimes enable logging of downloads of these files. Analyzing these logs helps us to answer questions like ""how many users are starting but not completing the download of the server discovery list?"", ""how is the downloaded data split between website assets and server discovery?"", and ""is an attacker making a denial-of-service attempt against our websites?""
S3 bucket access logs contain IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps. These logs are stored in S3 itself, so Amazon has access to these logs. (However, Amazon already serves the files, so they can already access this information.) Psiphon developers will download the logs, aggregate and analyze the data, and then delete the logs. Raw data will be kept only long enough to aggregate it and will not be shared with third parties.
PsiCash
The PsiCash system only collects information necessary for the functioning of the system, monitoring the health of the system, and ensuring the security of the system.
The PsiCash server stores per-user information to allow for operation of the system, including:
generated user access tokens
balance
last activity timestamp
PsiCash earning history, including what actions the rewards were granted for
PsiCash spending history, including what purchases were made
Creating a PsiCash account is optional. If an account is created, account-specific information such as username, password, and email address (if provided) are stored on the server. When logged in to a Psiphon client, the username is also stored locally.
In the user's web browser, some data is stored to allow for earning rewards and making purchases. This data includes:
generated user access tokens
when a PsiCash reward is allowed to be claimed again
For monitoring system health and security, system activity data is collected and aggregated. This data includes:
user country
balance
user agent string
client version
PsiCash earning and spending details
Individual user data is never shared with third parties. Coarse aggregate statistics may be shared, but never in a form that can possibly identify users.
PsiCash server resources are stored in AWS, which means Amazon has access to the data.
my.psi.cash
Users create and manage their PsiCash accounts on the my.psi.cash website.
reCAPTCHA
my.psi.cash uses Google’s reCAPTCHA v3 (hereinafter “reCAPTCHA”), which protects websites from spam and abuse by non-human users (i.e., bots). reCAPTCHA collects personal information that is required for the functioning of the technology and is subject to its own privacy policy. Use of my.psi.cash indicates acceptance of Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms.
Our use of reCAPTCHA is strictly limited to ensuring the continued functioning of my.psi.cash. reCAPTCHA technology performs an automatic analysis for each site request without requiring the user to take any additional actions. This analysis is based on interactions made by the user, and is used to mitigate bot and other malicious behaviour on our website. The data collected during analysis is forwarded to Google, where Google will use this data to determine if you are a human user. This analysis takes place in the background, and users are not advised it is taking place.
For more information about Google’s reCAPTCHA technology, please visit https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/.

my.psi.cash only uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to carry out activities that are essential for the operation of the website. Essential cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser, and do not represent any risk to your device. You can configure your browser settings to personalize how you would like your browser to handle cookies. Disabling essential cookies will degrade the functionality of this website.
Feedback
When you choose to submit feedback through Psiphon you will have the option of including diagnostic data. We use this data to help us troubleshoot any problems you might be having and to help us keep Psiphon running smoothly. Sending this data is entirely optional. The data is encrypted before you send it, and can only be decrypted by us. The information in the data varies by platform, but it may include:

Email Responder
When you send an email request to our email auto-responder server, we are able to see your email address. While your email is being processed it is saved to the email server's disk, and it is deleted as soon as it is processed (usually in a few seconds). Your email address may be written to the server system logs. These logs are deleted after one week.
Our email auto-responder server is hosted in the Amazon EC2 cloud. This means that Amazon is able to see the email you send and our response to you.
For each email we receive, we store the following information:
The date and time the email request was received.
The date and time the email request was replied to.
The size of the email.
The mail server the email request came from. (The three least specific parts of the domain name. For example, ne1.example.com , but not web120113.mail.ne1.example.com .)
App Stores
Note that if you get Psiphon from an ""app store"", such as the Google Play Store or Amazon AppStore, additional statistics may be collected by that store. For example, here is a description of what the Google Play Store collects: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/139628?hl=en",

We use the data to generate reports for internal data analysis, troubleshooting, and self-defense. These reports are aggregated statistical data and include non-personal data. We purge the logs after 180 days and only keep the reports. We use the reports for internal purposes, while recent ones may be used based on reasonable external requests, e.g., for fund-raising due diligence.
Device Related Data We may also collect data about the App version, App-specific IDs, and operating system versions, device models, location data of your mobile devices, as well as connection status during your usage of the Service. This data, excluding personally identifiable information, may be used for user research and service improvement purposes.
Web Page Contents We do not log the contents you browse, and we strictly enforce this policy.
Settings, Bookmarks, and Search History Settings will be saved only on your local device. If you choose to enable the Device Sync option, you agree to keep your bookmarks, browsing history, and active browsing tabs on our server. They will be securely stored, and can be retrieved via your Puffin account.
Files, Videos, and Images We do not store or cache any pictures, files, or videos you browse or watch on our servers. We will only cache images or files on your device for a better user experience, and you can always purge them via “Settings” in the Service. We use cloud storage services that you authorize in the Service to store files that you choose to download to the cloud, e.g., when you download a file on a web page, you can choose to download it to your cloud storage services. Only the user who grants access to the downloaded file can view it via the Service, and no one inside or outside of CloudMosa has access to any file you have chosen to download to cloud storage. We do not store file transfer data on our servers. Your download records save only on your device, and you can always purge the records via “Settings” in the Service. Videos are requested directly from the user’s device, and only on some rare cases when they won’t play or for network traversal reasons will be relayed via our servers. Live video streaming is not proxied via our servers but streamed directly to user’s devices. For some of our Services, videos or video streams may be relayed via our servers for security considerations. Vidq1eos will not be stored or cached on our servers.
Cloud Storage Authorization The download feature requires cloud storage authorization to work correctly. The authorization information saves only on your device will be passed via our servers to the cloud storage services you authorize in the Service when you choose to download files to your cloud storage accounts. You can always purge the cloud storage authorization information. However, if you deauthorize it, you will be asked to authorize the cloud storage services again whenever you wish to download files to your cloud storage accounts.
IP Addresses We use the servers in our data centers to render the result. The side effect is that the websites receive our server’s IP rather than yours. Puffin may forward your real IP address through the XFF header for websites that need this information. Although we pass your IP to websites via XFF, some websites don't support this standard.
Location Information Location data is frequently used on websites to serve various purposes. Some websites use it to present their content efficiently, e.g., video streaming. Some use JavaScript to request location information to provide relevant information to their users, e.g., for geo-restricted content. If you allow third-party apps or websites to use your current location, you are subject to their terms and privacy policy and practices. You should review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of such apps and websites to understand how they use your location and other information. You can disable Location Services on your device at any time.
Ads We partner with ad providers to serve ads to support our operation to offer the Services. Some ad providers will use your IP address we pass via the X-Forwarded-For (the “XFF”) header to serve geo-targeted ads.",

Last updated: November 30, 2023
Introduction
This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us.
The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law.
Definitions
First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity.
Personal data: “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” as the GDPR says. This includes data such as your IP address, device IDs, advertising IDs, and location. Below where we describe how we process personal data, we also list the specific purpose for doing so, as well as our legal basis under the GDPR (as those terms are defined below).
Data controller: The person or company that decides whether and how to process personal data.
Data processor: Someone who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller.
Legal basis: the specific legal grounds we use for processing personal data. The GDPR sets out six specific grounds for processing personal data. The ones most relevant to our Applications are as follows:
Consent: When we process personal data based on your consent, that means you’ve expressly given us permission to do so.
Contractual grounds: When we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract, for example to provide you with a service as described in our Terms of Service or some other agreement.
Legitimate interest: When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy.
Legal compliance: In some instances it is necessary for us to process personal data in order to fulfill other obligations under the law, for example detecting fraud, making sure you are who you say you are, etc.
Applications: the specific apps we offer, as mentioned below, including our desktop and mobile browsers.
Monetization: making money. Nearly all of our Applications are free to download and use. Therefore we monetize our products in various ways, mostly by selling advertising within the Applications themselves. The money we make helps us keep the lights on, pay the salaries of our staff, and continue developing the most innovative, independent browsers on the market. However, when we monetize our Applications, we never sell our users’ personal data to anyone.
Purpose: the specific reason or reasons we have for processing personal data.
Process or processing: collecting or using personal data. As defined in the GDPR, the word “processing” can mean doing almost anything with personal data. Below we have used it in this general sense when we have a general meaning in mind, and used more specific terms (like “store” or “share”) where appropriate.
Retention / retain: the time period for which we will continue to store data. In general, we do not process or store personal data longer than needed and therefore delete it after a certain period of time. Below we have included some more specific details on retention periods, which vary depending on the type of personal data at issue and the purpose for which it is processed.
Transfer: Personal data is “transferred” when it is sent or made permanently available to someone or some company outside the European Economic Area (or EEA - that is the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).
Opera Group: Our affiliated group of companies, including Opera Norway AS (a Norwegian company) which develops and publishes the Opera browsers, as well as other subsidiaries and affiliated companies around the world. For more information, see below.
Applications
The kinds of data (including personal data) that we process vary a great deal depending on which applications you use. You can read more about how each of our products processes data below.
Desktop Browsers
Desktop Browsers The following sections describe how we process data (including, but not limited to personal data) in our desktop applications – Opera browser for Computers (on Windows, Mac, and Linux), Opera GX desktop (on Windows and Mac), and our desktop Crypto Browser (on Windows and Mac). Opera Account None of our browsers require that you sign in before you can start using them. However, you have the option to create an Opera account to use certain services (like commenting on our Forum or blogs, VPN Pro, Loomi, Cashback, etc.). Again, you do not have to create an Opera account to use our browser applications for regular browsing activities, such as browsing the web. If you choose to create an Opera account, we ask for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively, you can use your Google, Facebook, Twitter, or VK account to sign in to an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we may collect information such as your name, profile picture, and email address from these social networks. If you use your Opera account in conjunction with a service like VPN Pro or Cashback, the data we process in connection with those services will be associated with your Opera account. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you choose to change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for two years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after six months of inactivity. Note also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them. The synced data is retained until your Opera account is deleted. Purpose: to allow you to access certain services. Legal basis: Contractual grounds (e.g., providing you the services). Personalized Content Our browsers may include personalized content features, such as a native newsfeed, or specialty content features such as Shopping Corner. When you interact with these features, we collect some information, such as the articles you read in the newsfeed, and your general location. We use this information to build a profile of your interests, which we use to select more relevant content for you. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID and may be stored on our servers for up to three months. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to withdraw your consent, you can go to the settings menu and disable personalized content. Purpose: Providing a more personalized experience and encouraging user engagement; monetization. Legal Basis: Consent. Browser Extensions You can install browser extensions or add-ons, which can be downloaded from the Opera add-ons website. Most of these extensions are developed by third parties and are subject to their own privacy terms. Please carefully review the terms before installing extensions. Please note that, as described in our Terms of Service, the sidebar messaging services (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc.) offered within Opera are provided by third parties. These services will not collect any data from you through the side-bar tool unless you specifically sign into them and use them. Opera does not collect any data when you use these services. Free VPN When you use our free, built-in browser VPN service, we do not log any personal data or other information related to your browsing activity or originating network address. As long as the browser VPN is active, all traffic in the browser is encrypted using strong industry standard encryption. VPN Pro Depending on where you live, you may be able to purchase a paid, premium VPN service called VPN Pro. VPN Pro is provided by a third-party service provider which owns, operates, and maintains the infrastructure which provides the Service. Data communicated through VPN Pro will be encrypted and routed through one of thousands of servers around the world. However, we do not promise that the service is absolutely secure. Despite our best efforts and the best efforts of our provider, criminals or other bad actors may still be able to access your data.
VPN Pro is a no-log service. We do not collect or store records of web pages you visit or links you click on in the servers dedicated for this Service.
To use VPN Pro you need to create and sign in to an Opera account. We use your Opera account to identify you as a valid subscriber to the VPN Pro service. We will share only information required to identify you as a subscriber with our third-party service provider, including a random ID number. We do not share your email, name, or other data or personal data with our third-party service provider. Purpose: To provide the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds. AI Chat Depending on which version of the browser you are using, you may be able to access an AI-powered chat assistant (‘AI Chat’). AI Chat is powered by OpenAI and Google (both US-based companies). To access AI Chat, you will need to sign into your Opera Account. We do not share your Opera Account data with anyone, including OpenAI or Google. For more information on how we use and retain Opera Account data, see the section on Opera Account above. Your input (all data that you choose to provide to AI Chat, including any personal data) is shared with OpenAI in order to provide you with responses. AI Chat also automatically processes your input to give you more precise or meaningful responses. Moreover, based on your inputs, AI Chat identifies prompts that are shared with Google for the purpose of generating Google Search Suggestions to enrich the response you receive from AI Chat. We will ask you for your consent for such data processing when you use AI Chat for the first time. After your session is complete, your chats will be stored locally on your device and on Opera servers but will not be retained by OpenAI. After 30 days your chats data will be automatically removed from Opera’s servers but will still be available on your device. At any time you can delete your chats (both stored locally and on Opera servers), by going to the chats list by clicking the chat bubble icon on the top bar of the chat. There you can either delete them one at a time by swiping, or you can select multiple chats and delete them all at once by clicking the bin icon. You may also opt - out from Google search suggestions feature via AI Chat Settings. Purpose: To provide and manage the service Legal basis: Legitimate interest (for Opera Account data), Consent (for any data you input to AI Chat) Cashback Cashback is an incentive program where you can earn rewards when purchasing goods or services from participating online merchants. When you choose to use the Cashback program and visit supported websites, we will collect merchant URLs, a list of your purchased items, transaction amounts, and IP address. This data is required for the Cashback service to function, and we also use it to provide more relevant partner deals, and to detect fraud and misuse of the service. To enable payouts, your Opera account will be linked with a payment service provider, which will share your customer ID, and relevant payment related data with Opera. Your payment data may be stored for up to five years due to regulatory requirements. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. Your Cashback data will be automatically deleted after two years of inactivity. You may delete your Cashback account, which will erase your personal data from the system, through the Account Setting menus in Cashback account. Purpose: To provide and improve the service. Legal basis: Contractual grounds, legal compliance. GX Gaming Servers Depending on where you live, the GX Gaming Servers service may allow you to purchase a license to access servers optimized for online gaming (the “GX Gaming Servers”). To use GX Gaming Servers you need to create and sign in to an Opera account. We use your Opera account to identify you as a valid subscriber to the GX Gaming Servers service. We will only share information required to identify you as a subscriber with: GTX Network Limited, our third-party service provider - a random ID number;
payments provider - e-mail, unique ID tracking number, country. GTX Network Limited may process additional data, including your name, address, email address, and phone number. Processing by GTX Network Limited is subject to their Terms and conditions and Privacy Policy. Data you upload to the GX Gaming Service will be stored on the GTX Network Limited servers while you continue to use the GX Gaming Service and for 2 months afterward. GTX Network Limited will store the additional data as above for 12 months.

You do not need an account to play most games; however, to get access to certain content (including paid content), participate in challenges, or to create content, you need an Opera account. After signing up for the first time, you will be prompted to provide your date of birth and an optional avatar. We use your date of birth to ensure you are eligible to use the service. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your profile page. Purpose: To provide the service. Legal Basis: Contractual grounds. My Flow If you use the “My Flow” function, a random ID is generated by the Flow server and assigned to each client device. These IDs are used solely to enable pairing functionality between Opera desktop and mobile applications and persist only while your devices are connected to My Flow. Your data is protected with end-to-end encryption and we retain it only as long as you continue to use the feature. You can disconnect your devices from My Flow, and delete your data through the application’s Settings menu. Crypto Wallet Depending on your location, some Opera browsers may allow you to access a non-custodial crypto “wallet” offered by our affiliate, Blueboard Limited (an Opera Group company). Blueboard is the data controller for this feature, and you can read their privacy statement here. Opera does not act as a data controller for this feature, but may process some data in order to help the wallet to function in our apps. SaviSwap SaviSwap is a free to use smart contract Service, provided by Opera, that finds and chooses for you the best available swap. If you use SaviSwap, Opera may collect the following data: your public wallet transaction history, asset balance, and public wallet addresses directly via our backend services which collect data directly from the blockchain or use 3rd party services (like for NFTs), which themselves gather data from the blockchain. We may share those data with swap providers to find the best swap for you. We store the data in the user’s local storage (a feature that is available natively in each browser) for caching purposes. Usage Statistics When you install an Opera application, a random installation ID is generated. We collect this identifier, as well as Machine ID, hardware specifications (model, release date, etc.), operating system, environment configuration, and feature usage data to improve our products and services. For example, we may use it to analyze how our users interact with our applications, or to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, or to detect and debug problems. We have no practical way of using this information to identify you personally. We retain this usage data for up to three years. You can opt out of reporting extended statistics through the settings menu and choosing not to “Help Opera”. Purpose: Improving our products. Legal basis: Legitimate interest (debugging and improving products and services). Crash Reports and Logs If an Opera application crashes, we collect a log that includes some information about your browser’s version, your operating system, platform and some memory data related to the crash. We collect this data with the sole purpose of improving our products and services. Crash logs are kept for up to five months. You can opt out of reporting this data to us through the settings menu of the browser. If you visit our websites, we may collect your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our websites. We use IP addresses of website visitors solely for this purpose and may keep these website access logs up to six months. Browser Assistant Opera for computers on Windows includes a component called Browser Assistant that displays notifications promoting the browser’s features or the browser itself. Browser Assistant checks if any notifications are pending on a scheduled basis and may report occurrences of certain system events (such as low battery, low hard disk space, new Wi-Fi network connected, another browser installed). Browser Assistant collects this data, as well as a randomly generated Opera ID so that we can determine and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the notifications that we display to users. We may retain this data for up to four years. You can opt out of this data collection via your browser settings by selecting not to help improve Opera. Purpose: Improving our products. Legal basis: Legitimate interest (improving our products by understanding effectiveness of notifications of users) . Malicious-site Check We use a fraud prevention framework (including Google Safe Browsing) to check the URLs you visit against lists of known, malicious websites to protect you online. We do not process any personal data in this context. Search Providers Opera browsers allow you to customize the search engine used in the browser address bar. In most cases Google is the default provider, but other providers (such as Bing) might be set as default based on which version of the Application you are using. You can always change your default provider in the settings menu. Opera does not share personal data with search engine providers to enable search within Opera browsers. Just like any other third-party website you might access, use of any search engine is subject to the terms of service and privacy policy offered by the specific search engine provider. Some of the web search services available in the Application may be provided by partners of CodeFuel Ltd. including, for example, bing.com. For information on the web search services data collection, please visit the search provider’s privacy policy. Personalized Ads & Profiling Based on data such as IP address, hashed user ID, and your general location, some of our Applications serve targeted ads. These ads are provided by our monetization partners. You can always adjust your personalized ad choices in the application’s “Settings” menu or through your operating system’s settings. As noted in our End User License Agreements and Terms of Service, our applications are generally provided for free and as such are ad-supported. Collecting this information helps us offset the costs of our business and helps provide a more personalized experience for the user. We may also combine this data with other elements – including categories of websites you search and visit, device information (model, release date, device IDs, hardware specifications, operating system, etc.), and categories of ads you have clicked on in our products - to build a better understanding of what our users are interested in. We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically. We process this data based on your consent. If you would like to view your options, or to withdraw your consent, please visit the settings menu of the application you are using. Purpose: Improving our products and services, monetization. Legal Basis: Consent. Speed Dials Our browsers include visual bookmarks on the home screen which we call Speed Dials. You can customize the Speed Dials through the Application’s settings menu. Some Speed Dials are ads provided by our advertising partners. If you choose to use Opera’s default Speed Dials, you may be redirected through Opera’s partners or other third parties. These partners and third parties may collect data from you independently of Opera. This data may include third party cookies, device IDs, and session statistics. If you wish to opt out of such data collection, you can easily configure your browser’s Cookie Settings to reject third party cookies. You may also choose not to receive Speed Dial suggestions, or to adjust your Speed Dials by deleting preset options based on your own preference. Web3 Guard Some Opera browsers may provide you with additional Web 3 security check features. Those features are enabled by default and are visible in your address bar. You may turn off the specific features at any time in the browser settings. Dapp Check is a feature that will look for known security risks connected to decentralised applications you are exploring, such as: If the Dapp contains malicious contracts
If the Dapp has a malicious owner
Whether the Dapp has been audited
Whether Dapp’s contracts are open source If a Dapp contains malicious contracts or is owned by a known malicious creator, you will be warned prior to entering the Dapp’s website. Dapp does checks based on the URL you are visiting against a database of Dapp security information that Opera maintains internally. This database is kept within your local storage, and the check itself is run locally any time you enter a website. Because of this, the check is performed without collecting any of your personal data, and without storing any of the URLs you visit. Seed Phrase Phishing Check is a feature that checks webpages you visit for suspicious seed-phrase phishing behaviors, such as: Common phishing keywords: the private key, seed phrase, mnemonic phrase, etc.
Common phishing properties: input box, list of wallet options to connect with
Certain sizes, numbers, and positions of text input components
Files and documents that include phishing patterns When a risk is detected, a message is displayed to warn you against engaging in risky interactions with a suspected phishing site. Seed Phrase Phishing Check monitors the DOM (document object model), a piece of the interfacing layer of the actual web page, and screens for any phishing patterns. So the check does not listen to or watch the actual content of your browsing, and does not collect, process, or share any of your browsing data or personal data. Promotion & Marketing We process some data in order to promote and market our products and services. Some of this data comes directly from you when you submit it to us for some specific purpose. For example, if you decide to provide feedback to Opera, or participate in a promotional campaign, contest, or survey, organized by Opera or our partners on behalf of Opera, we may ask for information such as your name, age, phone number, email, or postal address.

Thông tin này được chia sẻ như thế nào?
Những người mà trẻ liên hệ . Bạn nắm quyền kiểm soát việc những ai có thể giao tiếp với trẻ thông qua Messenger Kids. Bạn có thể phê duyệt từng lời mời kết nối riêng lẻ hoặc có thể chọn cho phép trẻ tự đưa ra và chấp nhận các lời mời kết nối mà không cần bạn phải phê duyệt từng lời mời. Bạn cũng có thể cho phép trẻ tham gia các cuộc trò chuyện nhóm với những người dùng Messenger/Messenger Kids không được bạn phê duyệt riêng. Nếu cho phép trẻ đưa ra và chấp nhận các lời mời kết nối hoặc tham gia các cuộc trò chuyện nhóm, bạn vẫn có khả năng xem xét và xóa người liên hệ. Bạn sẽ phải thay mặt trẻ chọn sử dụng các chức năng này và có thể chọn không sử dụng tiếp bất cứ lúc nào. Tên, ảnh đại diện, trạng thái hoạt động cũng như mối quan hệ của trẻ với bạn và với bất kỳ chủ tài khoản quản lý nào khác được chia sẻ với những người mà trẻ giao tiếp. Bạn có thể thực hiện các quyền kiểm soát có trong Bảng điều khiển dành cho phụ huynh để quyết định có cho phép những người liên hệ với trẻ nhìn thấy các thông tin chi tiết khác về tài khoản có trên tài khoản của trẻ (chẳng hạn như ngày sinh) hay không. Những người mà trẻ giao tiếp sẽ thấy nội dung trẻ chia sẻ với họ. Bạn nên xem xét cẩn thận danh bạ và các quyền của trẻ, bởi vì những người nhìn thấy tin nhắn của trẻ có thể chọn chia sẻ các tin nhắn đó với người không được phê duyệt để liên lạc với trẻ. Ví dụ: những người liên hệ với trẻ có thể tải xuống, chụp ảnh màn hình hoặc chia sẻ lại nội dung trong tin nhắn của trẻ cho người khác trên Messenger Kids hoặc trên các sản phẩm khác.
Phụ huynh và người giám hộ . Thông qua Bảng điều khiển dành cho phụ huynh, với vai trò là phụ huynh/người giám hộ, bạn có thể tải xuống hoặc xem tin nhắn có ảnh và video mà trẻ gửi hay nhận trên Messenger Kids. Bạn cũng có thể xem lại thông tin chi tiết về tài khoản của trẻ cũng như hoạt động của trẻ trên tài khoản đó. Hãy nhớ rằng phụ huynh/người giám hộ của người dùng Messenger Kids khác luôn có thể nhìn thấy thông tin trẻ chia sẻ với con họ.
Trẻ, phụ huynh hoặc người giám hộ khác: Những người quản lý tài khoản Messenger Kids là bạn bè của bạn trên Facebook (cũng như những người mà bạn mời tạo tài khoản Messenger Kids) có thể nhìn thấy tên, ảnh đại diện của trẻ và mối quan hệ của trẻ với bạn và với bất kỳ phụ huynh/người giám hộ nào khác có quyền quản lý. Chúng tôi muốn hỗ trợ trẻ tìm thấy bạn bè trên Messenger Kids. Để làm điều đó, bạn có thể chọn cho phép hiển thị thông tin của trẻ cho những người khác. Bạn có thể kiểm soát việc hiển thị này trong Bảng điều khiển dành cho phụ huynh.
Nhà cung cấp và nhà cung ứng dịch vụ của chúng tôi. Chúng tôi có thể chuyển thông tin mình thu thập được cho các nhà cung ứng dịch vụ cần thiết để hỗ trợ Messenger Kids, chẳng hạn như những công ty cung cấp cơ sở hạ tầng và hỗ trợ kỹ thuật (ví dụ: mạng lưới phân phối nội dung) hay cung cấp dịch vụ khách hàng hoặc phân tích cách mọi người sử dụng Messenger Kids để giúp chúng tôi cải thiện dịch vụ. Những đối tác này phải tuân thủ các nghĩa vụ nghiêm ngặt về bảo mật và giữ bí mật dữ liệu, chẳng hạn như những hạn chế về cách họ có thể sử dụng dữ liệu. Chúng tôi không bán bất cứ thông tin nào của bạn/con bạn cho bất kỳ ai khác và sẽ không bao giờ làm như vậy.
Các công ty thuộc Meta. Messenger Kids là do Meta cung cấp và chúng tôi có thể chia sẻ thông tin mình thu thập được trong Messenger Kids với Messenger Kids là do Meta cung cấp và chúng tôi có thể chia sẻ thông tin mình thu thập được trong Messenger Kids với Các công ty thuộc Meta để hỗ trợ hoạt động sử dụng nêu trên, cũng như để cải thiện dịch vụ do Các công ty thuộc Meta cung cấp. Ví dụ: khi phụ huynh sử dụng Messenger để giao tiếp với trẻ trên Messenger Kids, Meta sẽ sử dụng thông tin từ Messenger Kids đễ hỗ trợ hoạt động giao tiếp liền mạch giữa hai dịch vụ.
Chủ sở hữu mới. Trong trường hợp quyền sở hữu hoặc quyền kiểm soát tất cả hay một phần Messenger Kids có sự thay đổi, chúng tôi có thể chuyển thông tin cho chủ sở hữu mới.
Yêu cầu pháp lý hoặc yêu cầu của cơ quan hành pháp. Chúng tôi chia sẻ thông tin với cơ quan hành pháp hoặc theo yêu cầu pháp lý trong những trường hợp nêu bên dưới.
Làm thế nào phụ huynh có thể truy cập, quản lý và xóa thông tin về con mình?

Thông qua Bảng điều khiển dành cho phụ huynh, bạn có thể thực hiện các thay đổi đối với trang cá nhân Messenger Kids của trẻ, xóa người liên hệ, thay đổi các quyền mà bạn đã chọn cấp cũng như xem hình ảnh hay video trẻ đã gửi hoặc nhận. Ngoài ra, bạn còn có thể xem các tin nhắn của trẻ trên Messenger Kids và thông tin tài khoản của trẻ bằng cách tải bản sao thông tin đó xuống từ Bảng điều khiển dành cho phụ huynh.
Để ngăn Meta thu thập và sử dụng thông tin cá nhân của trẻ trên Messenger Kids, bạn có thể xóa Tài khoản Messenger Kids của trẻ thông qua Trung tâm trợ giúp của chúng tôi. Nếu bạn xóa tài khoản của trẻ, chúng tôi sẽ xóa thông tin trang cá nhân Messenger Kids, thông tin về hoạt động và người liên hệ, thông tin về thiết bị và bản sao các tin nhắn của trẻ, theo mô tả ở trên. Tuy nhiên, tin nhắn và nội dung do trẻ gửi hoặc nhận trước khi tài khoản bị xóa sẽ vẫn hiển thị với những người có thể chia sẻ lại tin nhắn và nội dung đó với người khác (như đã lưu ý ở trên).
Chúng tôi lưu trữ thông tin cho đến khi thông tin đó không còn cần thiết để cung cấp dịch vụ của chúng tôi hoặc cho đến khi tài khoản của trẻ bị xóa, tùy trường hợp nào xảy ra trước. Chúng tôi sẽ quyết định việc này theo từng trường hợp, dựa trên những yếu tố như bản chất của dữ liệu, lý do thu thập và xử lý dữ liệu, cũng như các nhu cầu lưu giữ vì mục đích vận hành hoặc pháp lý có liên quan. Ví dụ: theo yêu cầu của cơ quan hành pháp, chúng tôi có thể lưu giữ thông tin đăng ký để giúp cộng đồng Messenger Kids an toàn hơn.
Báo cáo hoạt động đáng ngờ
Theo mô tả ở trên, chúng tôi sử dụng thông tin mình có để tăng cường đảm bảo an toàn cho trẻ trên Messenger Kids. Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi cũng cung cấp công cụ báo cáo để trẻ sử dụng khi cần. Thông qua tài khoản Messenger Kids, trẻ có thể báo cáo nội dung không phù hợp (bao gồm nội dung mang tính quấy rối, bắt nạt, tình dục hoặc bạo lực) hay hoạt động đáng ngờ (chẳng hạn như trong trường hợp trẻ cho rằng ai đó đang giả mạo bạn bè hoặc người thân) và có thể chặn ngay lập tức cá nhân vi phạm trên Messenger Kids. Nếu trẻ báo cáo ai đó, chúng tôi sẽ thông báo cho bạn về việc này.
Chúng tôi đáp ứng các yêu cầu pháp lý hoặc ngăn chặn trường hợp gây hại như thế nào?
Chúng tôi truy cập, lưu giữ và chia sẻ thông tin của trẻ với các nhà quản lý, cơ quan hành pháp hoặc các cơ quan có thẩm quyền khác:
Để đáp ứng yêu cầu pháp lý nếu chúng tôi thực sự tin rằng luật pháp yêu cầu chúng tôi làm như vậy. Chúng tôi cũng có thể phản hồi các yêu cầu pháp lý khi thực sự tin rằng phản hồi này: là bắt buộc theo luật pháp tại lãnh thổ đó, có ảnh hưởng đến người dùng tại lãnh thổ đó và phù hợp với các tiêu chuẩn được quốc tế công nhận.
Khi chúng tôi thực sự tin rằng cần phải: phát hiện, ngăn chặn và xử lý hành vi gian lận, hành vi sử dụng trái phép Messenger Kids, hành vi vi phạm các điều khoản hoặc chính sách của chúng tôi hay hoạt động có hại hoặc bất hợp pháp khác; để bảo vệ chính chúng tôi (bao gồm các quyền, tài sản hay sản phẩm của chúng tôi), bạn hoặc người khác, kể cả trong quá trình điều tra hoặc thẩm vấn của cơ quan quản lý; hoặc để ngăn ngừa tử vong hay thương tích sắp xảy ra.
Thông tin chúng tôi nhận được về bạn hoặc trẻ có thể được truy cập và lưu giữ trong một khoảng thời gian dài khi thông tin đó là đối tượng của: yêu cầu/nghĩa vụ pháp lý, cuộc điều tra của chính phủ hay cuộc điều tra liên quan đến khả năng vi phạm các điều khoản/chính sách của chúng tôi hoặc nhằm ngăn ngừa thiệt hại. Chúng tôi cũng giữ lại thông tin của các tài khoản đã bị vô hiệu hóa vì vi phạm điều khoản trong ít nhất một năm để ngăn chặn hành vi tái lạm dụng hoặc hành vi khác vi phạm điều khoản.
Chúng tôi vận hành và truyền tải dữ liệu trong các dịch vụ toàn cầu của mình như thế nào?
Chúng tôi chia sẻ thông tin trên toàn cầu, cả trong nội bộ Chúng tôi chia sẻ thông tin trên toàn cầu, cả trong nội bộ Các công ty thuộc Meta và với đối tác bên ngoài của mình, cũng như với những người mà bạn kết nối và chia sẻ trên toàn thế giới theo chính sách này. Ví dụ: thông tin của bạn có thể được chuyển/truyền đến hoặc được lưu trữ và xử lý tại Hoa Kỳ hay các quốc gia khác ngoài quốc gia cư trú của bạn cho những mục đích được mô tả trong chính sách này. Các hoạt động chuyển dữ liệu nói trên là cần thiết để cung cấp những dịch vụ được quy định trong các Điều khoản của Messenger Kids và để vận hành cũng như cung cấp sản phẩm của chúng tôi cho bạn trên phạm vi toàn cầu. Chúng tôi sử dụng các điều khoản hợp đồng tiêu chuẩn, dựa vào những quyết định về sự bảo vệ tương xứng của Ủy ban châu Âu đối với một số quốc gia (nếu có) và sẽ xin bạn cho phép chuyển các dữ liệu này đến Hoa Kỳ cũng như các quốc gia khác.
Các cập nhật và thay đổi đối với Chính sách này
Trước khi thay đổi cách thức thu thập, sử dụng hoặc chia sẻ dữ liệu như trình bày trong Chính sách này, chúng tôi sẽ thông báo cho bạn (với vai trò là phụ huynh/người giám hộ của trẻ có tài khoản Messenger Kids) và để bạn có cơ hội xem kỹ các thay đổi đó trước khi chúng có hiệu lực với trẻ.

At Hinge, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.
We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information, and we do not take this lightly.
Our commitment to privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that our decisions are taken with the utmost respect for your privacy.
Our commitment to transparency. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we’re doing our best to write our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!
Our commitment to security. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.
PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to Hinge’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
If you are a California resident, please see our California Privacy Statement, which supplements this Privacy Policy.
We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
This Privacy Policy applies from July 1, 2023. The previous version of this Privacy Policy, available here, will apply until then.
1. Who We Are
If you live in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “data controller”) is:
MTCH Technology Services Limited
1 Hatch Street Upper
Dublin 2
Dublin
D02 PY28
Ireland
If you live outside the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your information is:
Hinge, Inc.
809 Washington Street, Third Floor

2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand Hinge. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.
Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
3. Information We Collect
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
Information you give us
You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:
When you create an account, you provide us with at least your phone number and email address, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender, date of birth, and who you’d like to connect with.
When you complete your profile, you have the option to share your sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious beliefs, and political opinions with us. Where you provide such elements to us, you consent to us using it for the purposes identified and as laid out in this Privacy Policy. You can also share additional information with us, such as details on your bio and your interests, as well as content such as photos, videos, and audio clips. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera, photo album, or microphone.
When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us with information related to the purchases you make and our payment processors with information such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.
When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
If you contact us (e.g., through our customer care team or on social media), we collect the information you give us during the interaction.
If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.
Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish to operate and secure the services, and to keep our community safe.
Information we receive from others
In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
Users
Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.
Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you. Social Media
You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your Hinge account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media accounts (e.g., Facebook or Instagram).

Affiliates
Hinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses. Match Group considers the safety and security of users a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services.

If you were banned from another Match Group service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services. Other Partners
We may receive information about you from our partners where our ads are published on a partner’s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our users’ safety and security.
Information generated or automatically collected when you use our services
When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details.
Usage Information
Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., when you logged in, features you’ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, and when you matched and exchanged messages with them).

Device Information
We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings and, in some cases, disable entirely), and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.
We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings and, in some cases, disable entirely), and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser. Information collected by cookies and similar technologies
We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels and SDKs) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Hinge, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
Other information with your consent
Precise geolocation data: If you give us your consent, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) from your device. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it, and our services that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.
Selfie Verification data: If you choose to participate in our Selfie Verification feature, we collect your face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, to verify that you’re the real you. You can learn more about Selfie Verification and how we process your face geometry data here.
Other information: We may collect other information with your permission, such as photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services).
4. How We Use Information
The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you and our community safe, and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.

F. To ensure legal compliance
Comply with legal requirements
Assist law enforcement
For information on how we process personal information through profiling and automated decision-making, please see our FAQ.
To process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:
Provide our service to you: The reason we process your information for purposes A and B above is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features to you and other users.
Legitimate interests: We process your information for purposes C, D and E above, based on our legitimate interest. For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our users safe and we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a legal action.
Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We process your information for purpose F above where it is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement. We also keep data evidencing consents users give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.
Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you’re consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific information such as your precise geolocation or use your information for certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in relation to the collection of our precise geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered “special” or “sensitive”). In any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
5. How We Share Information
Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.
With other users
You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being visible.
If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.
If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that you violated our Terms of Use), we may communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.

For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising vendors.
We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any vendor or working with any partner. Our vendors and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.

Sharing of information laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use standard contract clauses (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism. We are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the recent Court of Justice for the European Union’s ruling on transfers of personal data to the USA.

For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other user will have to contact us to submit a separate request for their information. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.
If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, or Connecticut, USA, if we deny your privacy request, you may be able to appeal by contacting us here, and explicitly referencing “Privacy Request Appeal.” If you have concerns about the result of your appeal you may contact the attorney general for your state. Additionally, please note that we do not “sell” your personal data, or use it for “targeted advertising” or “profiling” in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, as those terms are defined by applicable law in your state, so no opt-out choice is necessary.
In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here, and in the United Kingdom here. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.
8. How Long We Retain Your Information
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other users. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for a period of two years. After your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:
To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure. During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.
Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:
a) We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements. We may also need to keep “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents users give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.
b) We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent users who were banned or people who were found to be under the age of 18 from opening a new account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our users.
c) Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).
9. No Children Allowed
Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.
We process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative of Hinge, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss the entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information, transfers of personal information, rights you may have under applicable law, how to contact us and California-specific information.
If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us. We use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we may process identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers that assist us with recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with Match Group companies (for instance if you have a business relationship with employees of an affiliate). We keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.
11. Privacy Policy Changes
Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.

The App and Sites are global, and your information will be sent to and used in the United States and the UK regardless of the country you reside in. This Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully!
Who we are
The App and Sites are operated by the “Bumble Group” (also referred to in this policy as “we” or “us”) which includes Bumble Holding Limited, Badoo Trading Limited and Bumble Trading LLC, all of which are controllers of personal information collected and processed through the Bumble App and Sites.
The Bumble Group has designated a Data Protection Officer and they can be reached by emailing DPO@bumble.com or by post at the following address: The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS.
1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.
Registration Information
When you download the App and create an account (“Account”), we may collect certain information (“Registration Information”) about you, such as:
Name;
Username;
Email address;
Mobile number;
Gender identity;
Date, time, and location of birth;
Sexual preference;
Photographs;
Location; and
Login information for social media accounts that you connect to your Bumble Account (this could include, for example, your Facebook and Instagram accounts). For more information about this, see “Linking other Accounts to Bumble” in section 7 below.
Once you register, you will be able to review and change this information at any time just by logging in to Bumble (other than your date of birth and location (which, if you have given Bumble access to your location in your device settings, is automatically updated based on the location of your device)). It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept up to date. If your phone number changes, please ensure that you update this in your account.
The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users (robots are not welcome!). Registration Information such as your sexual preference, name and username may be visible to other Users who view your profile page.
For Users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls within the following categories of “personal information”, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):
A. Identifiers, such as name and location;
B. Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial information;
C. Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and medical conditions;
D. Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;
E. Biometric information;
F. Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history and interactions with our Sites and App;
G. Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;
H. Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos and videos;
I. Professional or employment-related information, such as work history and prior employer;
J. Non-public education information; and
K. Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s preferences and characteristics.
Profile Information
We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information which is open to abuse and misuse on your profile.
When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to communicate with other Users, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on Bumble.
Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)
For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Bumble accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Bumble network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your profile).
If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that we can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes until we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the applicable retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable steps to permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems.
Purchases Information
If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes.
Bumble uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behaviour that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If a transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified that their transaction cannot be processed and affected Users can contact Bumble to contest the decision.
Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any account(s) that you have on other Bumble Group platforms/applications, such as Badoo, may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.
Geolocation Information
If you have given Bumble access to your location in your device settings, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device’s coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we use it to personalise the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the general locality information to be displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you the profiles of other Users who are near you.
If you have given Bumble access to your location, but wish to turn this off, you can do so by the following methods:
iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Bumble Android — settings, location, Bumble, permissions, location
Device and Photos Information
We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique device identifier, device model, and operating system, for a number of purposes, as set out in this policy. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device’s address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.
We also collect data about your photos, such as which are the photos that users spend time on or which are the photos that have the best lighting, etc. We may use that data to rearrange your profile photos aiming to position them in a way that is favourable to you. You may opt-out of this feature through our app settings.
Links
We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Bumble including third party services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
Bumble Success Stories, Surveys and other Contributions
From time to time, we run surveys for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to provide feedback, a testimonial or take part in marketing campaigns (for example, if you let us know that you have found a match on the App, we may contact you to ask if you would be happy to feature in advertising for Bumble). Such surveys and marketing campaigns are optional and more information will be provided at the point of contact. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact our Customer Support Team via our Feedback Page.
When you Contact Customer Support
If you contact our Customer Support team via our Feedback Page, we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address, as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you) for 6 years after deletion of your account.
Cookies and similar technologies
When you visit our Sites or when you use our App, we may collect personal data from you automatically by using cookies or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device or browser that allows us to recognise and remember you.
If you would like to find out more about cookies, including how we use them and what choices are available to you, please refer to our Cookie Policy.
2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION.
Our main goal is to ensure your experience on Bumble is an enjoyable one and you don’t end up getting stung! In order to deliver an enjoyable experience to you, we may use your Registration and other information to:
offer you our services and features;
contact you with information about the App (e.g., updates and new features);
personalise the App/Sites and the content we deliver to you;
conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with the App/Sites;
to test new technologies and processes designed to enhance and improve the App/Sites;
resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and to enforce our Terms & Conditions;
investigate fraud, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our Terms & Conditions.
to send you information about the promotions and offers we have available (e.g., specify the types of goods/services/offers to be provided via direct marketing) by direct marketing or other modes of communication - if you’ve signed up for our communications or otherwise told us it’s OK. We will not use your information in email direct marketing unless you give us your consent during the Account creating process or via Settings in the App (you can withdraw from marketing at any time via Settings in the App or by using the opt-out mechanisms and links provided in each message); and
protect our Users and third parties from harm.
Our Matching Algorithms
We have developed matching algorithms to predict your compatibility with other users and so we can show you people we think are a good match for you. Our matching algorithms use the following data about you to predict your compatibility with others and generate profile recommendations: the things you tell us about yourself in your profile; information about your activity in our apps; whether you are a photo verified user; and your device coordinates, which are necessary to understand your proximity to other members. The legal basis for processing profile and proximity information is that this is necessary for the provision of our contractual services to you pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Where we process information about your app activity, this is based on our legitimate interests pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and specifically our legitimate interest in generating more personalised and relevant recommendations for who you can match with in our App. If you have chosen to include sensitive information in your profile, such as information about your beliefs, the processing of this information is based on your voluntary and explicit consent.
Moderation Practices
We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts (including photos and any other information uploaded onto user profiles) and messages for content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If an account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will be subject to a warning and the user’s access restricted and/or blocked. Affected Users can contact Bumble to contest the decision.
If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve the right to terminate or restrict access to your Account.
Lawful Basis
Under EU and UK data protection laws, we are required to tell you our lawful basis for using your data and we have set this out in the table below. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at any time. Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to our use of your data.

Processing We Perform To Improve Services For Students
What we’re doing. We process personal data to understand which of our users may be in college or university. To do this, we look at historic location data to understand whether your device’s coordinates match to a general university or college area. For this activity, we use recent historic data regarding where you opened the Bumble app and we’ll keep a simple “at campus yes/no” result based on our findings. What we don’t do. We do not track your real-time movements as part of this activity and we do not identify or store information about where you are studying. To protect your privacy, we do not retain any of the location data used for this activity and it is permanently deleted once the results are generated. Why we’re doing this. We’ll combine the results of this processing with other relevant information we hold for the following purposes: so we can send the right offers, events and features to the right users; to understand which Bumble events are popular with the student demographic and which aren’t working so well; and to improve the design of the App to meet the needs of students. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests. We have a legitimate interest in providing a more tailored app experience for student users and in optimising their chances of finding the right connections. Please note this data processing only affects Bumble App users who identified the United States or Canada as their location when registering for the App (we exclude users in Quebec) and who are in the 18 to 24 age group.
3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.
Our policy is to not disclose your Registration Information or personal data, except in the limited circumstances described here:
Circumstances where data may be disclosed Disclosed data Service Providers – We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your Registration Information or personal data with these third parties, but only for the purposes of performing these functions and providing such services. More information about this is available directly below. This could include all data, including all CCPA Categories listed above Moderators – To monitor activity on the App and approve content.

Cardholder name, cardholder address, card number, payment amount, transaction date/time (CCPA Categories A, B, and D) Law and Harm – As we mentioned in the Terms & Conditions, we think it is very important that all Users behave whilst using the App. We will cooperate with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. We will cooperate with lawfully made law enforcement requests for information from within or outside your country of residence where we are required to by law. This may include where there is an investigation into alleged criminal behaviour or to protect the vital interests of a person. We may preserve or disclose any of your information, including your Registration Information, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary: to comply with a binding direction court order, or lawful request;
to protect the safety of any person;
to address fraud, security or technical issues e.g. through anti-spam providers to protect the service from criminal activity; or
to protect our rights or property or those of third parties. In such cases we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. This could include any personal data that Bumble holds about you, depending on the nature of the request or the issue that we are dealing with, including all CCPA Categories listed above Business Transfers – In the event that a Bumble Group entity or any of its affiliates undergoes a business transition or change of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re-organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal data. This could include all personal data that Bumble holds about you, including all CCPA Categories listed above Marketing Services Providers – To help us serve marketing and advertising on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. More information on this is available below Advertising identifier associated with your device (Device ID), estimated location (based on your IP address), age, gender and data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our App or created an account with our App), hashed email address (for ‘custom audiences’ only) (CCPA Categories B, C, G, F and K) Anti-Spam and Anti-Fraud – Your data may be shared with other Bumble Group companies, for example, to block accounts and suspected fraudulent payment transactions as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DISCLOSURES
Service Providers
We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us (“Service Providers”). The suppliers with which Bumble shares User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our App, Sites and services a User engages with. For example, to provide our services to Users, we typically use the following suppliers:
Billing services – to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App (for example, Google Play)
Authentication services – to allow customers to authenticate their account (for example, Twilio)
Social media providers – to allow customers to create/connect their Bumble account with their account(s) on such platforms (for example Facebook, Instagram or Spotify)
Product improvement and market research – we use third party platforms (such as Typeform) and agencies (such as Kantar) to carry out customer surveys and market research to improve our products and services
IT services – some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our business may process Users’ personal data (for example, if a User contacts us via social media with a support inquiry, their inquiry is processed by our community management software provider Khoros)
We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible and our suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.
Marketing Services Providers
We partner with providers of marketing services (such as Facebook for example) (‘Marketing Services Providers’) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. For example:
to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a Bumble account;
to show Bumble adverts to users who have visited the Bumble App/Sites but haven’t yet created a Bumble account;
to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers holds about you (also known as a Lookalike Audience); or
to include you in a ‘custom audience’ that will receive Bumble advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a particular advertisement).
We share a limited amount of your personal data with these Marketing Services Providers, such as:
the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer) know when an ad has been viewed or clicked in an app, and when an ad causes a ‘conversion’ (for example, downloading the app advertised to you))
your estimated location (based on your IP address)
age and gender
data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you downloaded our App, created an account with our App, or details of any purchases made on Site or in App)
a hashed* version of your email address (to create ‘custom audiences’).
*Hashing is a way of encrypting information by turning it into a combination of random numbers and letters - this code cannot be traced back to the email address. When hashed email addresses are sent to a Marketing Service Provider, they’re then matched against the Provider’s own existing list of their own users’ hashed information and our ads are served to those of our users who have successfully been matched with the Provider’s. Matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted by the Provider.
For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.
In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.
Facebook
Where we share data with Facebook as our Marketing Service Provider (including via the Facebook “Like” function), we are Joint Data Controllers with Facebook Ireland for this processing. This arrangement means that Bumble has to provide you this notice, but you should contact Facebook if you wish to exercise your data protection rights. Further information, including how Facebook enables you to exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as independent data controller can be found in Facebook Ireland’s Data Policy. If you want more information relating to the nature of the arrangement we have in place with Facebook, please email DPO@bumble.com.
This data referred to above can include actions that you take on our website such as your interactions with our Sites or other information collected from cookies or similar technologies including the Facebook pixel. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you and people like you (including on social media such as Facebook).
4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.
We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.
When using the Bumble App, you should assume that anything you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users and non-users of the App. We want our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.
Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. You may also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when you add certain Bumble badges to your profile, such as your religion and political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on Bumble may reveal information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through the addition of badges to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of this information and making it public to other Users.
Your Bumble profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram or Spotify – see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be users of the App. For example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.
Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only), Users are provided with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is required by local laws) and that Bumble has no control over how users may then publish or use that information.
If you log in to or access the App through your Facebook account or another third-party account on a device which you share with others, remember to log out of the App and the relevant third-party account when you leave the device in order to prevent other users from accessing your Bumble account.
5. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.
Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use Bumble.
Bumble does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration.
6. SECURITY.
Here at Bumble, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate security measures to help protect your information against loss, misuse and unauthorised access, or disclosure. We use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls.
Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:
Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account! Please don’t share the password you use to access your Bumble Account with anyone else! Change your password periodically.
If you ever think someone has had access to your password or Account, please follow the steps set out here. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.
7. LINKING OTHER ACCOUNTS TO BUMBLE.
Using your social media details to sign in to Bumble
When you sign in to our App using your Facebook account, you give permission to Facebook to share with us your name and profile picture. Unless you opt-out, you also give permission to Facebook to share with us your email address (if there is one associated with your Facebook account), date of birth, profile photos, gender, Page likes and current town/city.
If you register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your Apple login, a name (that can be edited by you) and an email (you can choose to hide your email and Apple will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private). This email address will be linked to your Bumble account and will be used to retrieve your Bumble account.
We will then use this personal data to form your Bumble account. If you remove the Bumble app from your Facebook settings, or from your Apple ID, we will no longer have access to this data. However, we will still have the personal data that we received when you first set up your Bumble account using your Facebook or Apple ID (you must delete your Bumble account entirely for us to no longer have access to this data).
Linking social media accounts to your Bumble account
You may link your Bumble account with your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify accounts. This allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to your Bumble account (for example, Instagram photos, or your top Spotify artists).
We only receive the limited information that Instagram or Spotify permits to be transferred (as detailed by Instagram/Facebook/Spotify and agreed by you when you first connect your account from such platforms with your Bumble account).
If you no longer want to link your Bumble account to your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account, please visit the settings in your Instagram, Facebook or Spotify account and follow the instructions to remove the Bumble app access permissions. Please note that any information already added to your Bumble account from those platforms will not be deleted unless you delete it within your Bumble account as well.
8. INFORMATION FOR BFF MEMBERS.
If you use BFF, you can populate your profile with information (like your beliefs and political leanings). You can provide this information as part of your profile, but there’s no obligation to do so.
You should assume that whatever information you share in BFF, including which Hives you’ve joined, can be seen by any BFF member. Please note BFF members will not be able to see chat discussions until they join the specific chat and when they join, they’ll see the full chat history.
How we process personal data in BFF and our legal bases for processing
We offer the opportunity in BFF to join Hives built around locations or topics. We’ll automatically recommend Hives you can join based on your location, activity, “my life” and “my interests” information.
The processing of your location data is necessary in order to perform our contract with you and deliver the Hives service to you.
The processing of your profile and activity information in order to make Hive recommendations is based on our legitimate interests. It is in our legitimate interests to use this information to recommend relevant Hives to you.
Please note that if you upload and choose to share sensitive information (such as sexuality and beliefs), you are explicitly consenting to sharing that information with other BFF members.

9. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.
For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those listed at section 10 below) under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the Act:
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you and explain how we have collected, used and shared your personal information over the past 12 months. You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you can write to us at feedback@team.bumble.com.
From time to time, as part of a joint promotion with a third party, we may, if you participate in such promotion, disclose your contact information to the third party to allow them to market their products or services to you. Where this is a condition for participation in a promotion, we will always let you know before when you enter the promotion. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.
In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our Users’ personal information over time and across third-party online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different online services when the users use the operator’s service. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual User’s online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.
10. YOUR RIGHTS.
Privacy laws applicable in your country may give you the following rights:
Right to be informed: what personal data an organisation is processing and why (we provide this information to you in this Privacy Policy). Right of access: you can request a copy of your data. Right of rectification: if the data held is inaccurate, you have the right to have it corrected. Right to erasure: you have the right to have your data deleted in certain circumstances. Right to restrict processing: in limited circumstances, you have the right to request that processing is stopped but the data retained. Right to data portability: you can request a copy of certain data in a machine-readable form that can be transferred to another provider. Right to object: in certain circumstances (including where data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests or for the purposes of marketing) you may object to that processing. Rights related to automated decision-making including profiling: there are several rights in this area where processing carried out on a solely automated basis results in a decision which has legal or significant effects for the individual. In these circumstances your rights include the right to ensure that there is human intervention in the decision-making process.
The particular rights which are applicable to you (which might include other rights not listed above) may vary depending on your country. You should make yourself aware of the rights you have under applicable privacy laws in your country.
If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our Feedback Page or email our Data Protection Officer at DPO@bumble.com. You can also contact us by post at the following address: The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS. For your protection and the protection of all of our Users, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity before we can answer the above requests.
If you have a concern about how we have processed your request or your personal data, you should contact us in the first instance via the contact details listed above.
If you feel we have not resolved your concern, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).

11. DATA LOCATIONS.
We want you to be able to access Bumble wherever you happen to be in the world. To enable us to provide that service, we operate a global network of servers including in the US, UK, EU, and (for Users located in Russia) Russia. The hardware is located in third-party data centres but is owned by the Bumble Group. Data collected by Advertising Partners and other Service Providers may also be held outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place such as: EU approved model clauses (which can be found here), and implementing robust contractual standards. If you want more information relating to the nature of the safeguards we have in place, please email DPO@bumble.com.
12. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION.
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted by applicable law. Please see “Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)” in Section 1, above, to learn about our retention policy with respect to biometric information.
When your Account is deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable in the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally deleted. After 28 days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:
we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some personal data may be kept for tax and accounting purposes); we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account information and a record of the behaviour that led to the block - this information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries or legal claims concerning the block); there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security (for example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account).
Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by others. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.
Thanks for reading, we hope we didn’t drone on for too long!
13. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.
As Bumble evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at bumble.com/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you, for example, via an email to the email associated with your Account or by posting a notice within Bumble.

PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to MATCH’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.
This Privacy Policy applies from 13/12/2022.
The previous version of this Privacy Policy, available here , applies until then.

2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand MATCH. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.
Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy — not this Privacy Policy — applies.
3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
Information you give us
You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:
When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials or phone number, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.
When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.
When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.
If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.
Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services.
Information we receive from others
In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
Users
Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.
Social Media
You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your MATCH account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram…).
Affiliates
MATCH is part of the Match Group family of businesses. Match Group considers the safety and security of users a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services.
Other Partners
We may receive information about you from our partners, including when MATCH accounts can be created through a partner’s service (in which case they pass along registration information to us) or where MATCH ads are published on a partner’s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our users’ safety and security.
Information generated when you use our services
When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:
Usage Information
Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., when you logged in, features you’ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, when you exchanged with them, number of messages you send and receive).
Device Information
We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings), identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.
Other Information with your Consent
If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude). The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services). Additionally, if you choose to participate in our Selfie Verification feature, we collect your face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions, to verify that you’re the real you. You can learn more about Selfie Verification and how we process your face geometry data here.
4. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES
We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, SDKs) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including MATCH, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION
The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe, and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons for which we use your information, together with practical examples.

Assist law enforcement
For information on how we process personal information through profiling and automated decision-making, please see our FAQ.
To process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:
Provide our service to you: The reason we process your information for purposes A and B above is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features.
Legitimate interests: We process your information for purposes C, D and E above, based on our legitimate interest. For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our users safe and we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a legal action.
Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We process your information for purpose F above where it is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement. We also keep data evidencing consents users give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.
Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you’re consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific information such as your precise geolocation or use your information for certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in relation to the collection of our precise geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered “special” or “sensitive”). In any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
6. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.
With other users
You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being visible.
If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.
If someone submits a report involving you (such as claim that you violated our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines), we may communicate to the report actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.
With our service providers and partners
We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations. We also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.
We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. Our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.
With our affiliates
MATCH is part of the Match Group family of businesses.
We share your information with affiliates for limited legitimate purposes as laid out below:
to make all Match Group platforms safer, by making sure that when a bad actor is found on one of them (for instance on our services), it is not only addressed there (for instance by banning them), but also on the others;
for them to assist us in data processing operations, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Their assistance may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, finance and accounting assistance, improving our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
in order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse. Examples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we think might be interesting to you based on your profile.
for other legitimate business purposes including corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting, where and as allowed under applicable laws.
For corporate transactions
We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.
With law enforcement / when required by law
We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
To enforce legal rights
We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
With your consent or at your request
We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.
We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.
7. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS
The sharing of information laid out in Section 6 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use standard contract clauses (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism. We are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the recent Court of Justice for the European Union’s ruling on transfers of personal data to the USA.

Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other user will have to contact us to provide their written consent before the information is released. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.
Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.
In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here, and in the United Kingdom here. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.
9. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5 ) and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other users. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for a period of two years. After your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:
To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure . During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims. Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below: We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements . We may also need to keep “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents users give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law. We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase for five years to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent users who were banned or people who were found to be under the age of 18 from opening a new account, to ensure the safety and vital interests of our users. Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).
10. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.
11. JOB CANDIDATES, CONTRACTORS AND VENDOR REPRESENTATIVES
We also process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative of MATCH, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss the entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information , transfers of personal information , rights you may have under applicable law , how to contact us .
If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us. We use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we may process identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers that assist us with recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with Match Group companies (for instance if you have a business relationship with employees of an affiliate). We keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.
12. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive on making sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.

We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.
We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.
We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies.

We work hard to keep your information secure. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.

This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.

WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Chispa. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our ""services"" in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we've added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services. Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below. Information you give us You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes: When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth. When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered ""special"" or ""sensitive"" in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information. When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information. When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials. When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter. If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service. If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request. Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services. Information we receive from others In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including: Other Users Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you. Social Media You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Chispa account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us. Other Partners We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance when Chispa accounts can be created through a partner's websites (in which case they pass along registration information to us) or where Chispa ads are published on a partner's websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign's success). Information collected when you use our services When you use our services, we collect information about which features you've used, how you've used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details: Usage Information We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you've been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive). Device information We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including: hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device' settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address); information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength; information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses. Other information with your consent If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren't using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).
COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a ""Do Not Track"" (""DNT"") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Chispa, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together with practical examples. To administer your account and provide our services to you Create and manage your account Provide you with customer support and respond to your requests Complete your transactions Communicate with you about our services, including order management and billing To help you connect with other users Analyze your profile and that of other users to recommend meaningful connections Show users' profiles to one another To ensure a consistent experience across your devices Link the various devices you use so that you can enjoy a consistent experience of our services on all of them. We do this by linking devices and browser data, such as when you log into your account on different devices or by using partial or full IP address, browser version and similar data about your devices to help identify and link them. To serve you relevant offers and ads Administer sweepstakes, contests, discounts or other offers Develop, display and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our services and other sites Communicate with you by email, phone, social media or mobile device about products or services that we think may interest you To improve our services and develop new ones Administer focus groups and surveys Conduct research and analysis of users' behavior to improve our services and content (for instance, we may decide to change the look and feel or even substantially modify a given feature based on users' behavior) Develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new interests-based feature further to requests received from users). To prevent, detect and fight fraud or other illegal or unauthorized activities Address ongoing or alleged misbehavior on and off-platform Perform data analysis to better understand and design countermeasures against these activities Retain data related to fraudulent activities to prevent against recurrences To ensure legal compliance Comply with legal requirements Assist law enforcement Enforce or exercise our rights, for example our Terms To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases: Provide our service to you: Most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you. Legitimate interests: We may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so. For instance, we analyze users' behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes. Consent: From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users' information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users' information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others. With other users You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you're comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it. If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings. With our service providers and partners We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations. We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners. We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations. With other Match Group businesses Chispa is part of the Match Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes websites and apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24, OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click here). We share your information with other Match Group companies to benefit you in two respects: for other Match Group companies to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Assistance provided by other Match Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding how our service is used and users' behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
In order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse. Examples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we feel would be interesting to you based on your search criteria. We may also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws. We may also share user information with other Match Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior. In some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms. For corporate transactions We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control. When required by law We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person. To enforce legal rights We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing. With your consent or at your request We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information. We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.
CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (""EEA""), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.
YOUR RIGHTS We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools: Access / Update tools in the service . Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that's associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here. Device permissions . Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality. Deletion . You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service. We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember: Reviewing your information . Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here. Updating your information . If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth. Uninstall . You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities. Accountability . In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To request this notice, please submit your request here. Please allow 30 days for a response. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures. We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately here.
HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account, unless: we must keep it to comply with applicable law; we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law; there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account. Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.
PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES Because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.",

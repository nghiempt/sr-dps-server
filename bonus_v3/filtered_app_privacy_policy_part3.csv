As a result, Pixocial may ""sell"" the following categories of personal information: identifiers (e.g., advertising IDs); internet activity; geolocation data; and inferences drawn to create a profile.
California residents may opt-out of the ""sale"" of their personal information by turning off the switch of ""Do Not Sell My Personal Information"" under the tab of ""Personalization & Data"". California residents also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of their rights conferred by the CCPA.
If you are a resident of California, every year we will provide you free of charge with an opportunity to obtain a list of third parties to which we have disclosed or with whom we have shared your personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the previous year. If you are a resident of California and wish to obtain this list, you may send an email with the subject ""AirBrush - The right to privacy of a California resident"" to [email protected] or send a registered mail to Unit 8106B, Level 81, International Commerce Centre, 1 Austin Road West, Kowloon, Hong Kong (attention: Legal Department, Pixocial).

Your privacy is very important to us. The following explains how we collect, use, protect, and disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, Message Data, and Contact Data when you use the application. This Privacy Policy also explains your choices for managing your information preferences. By using the application, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect
Personal Information.
We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, mobile telephone number, e-mail, and other personally identifiable information that you provide us with (""Personal Information""). The decision to provide certain Personal Information is optional. If you choose not to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to use certain features of the application.
Usage Data.
We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user (""Usage Data""). For example, when you download and use the application, we automatically collect information such as your device type, operating system version and type, IP address, and certain unique device identifiers (such as Android ID, MAC address, and IDFA). We may also collect location information, such as your device GPS coordinates, unless you configure your device operating system settings to prevent our collection of location information. Additionally, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of Web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, and the time and duration of your usage of the application. We use this information to enhance the services we offer and to help us understand how people use the application.
Messages.
When you use the application, we process and store information relating to the log and connection data, and other related information.
Contacts.
With your permission, we will collect from your mobile address book, your contacts, including names, telephone numbers, email addresses, and social media handles, if available (""Contact Data"").
How We Use Information and When We May Share Information
Generally. We use Personal Information, Message Data and Contact Data for internal purposes only, such as to provide you with the application, to notify you of new products or services, and to otherwise communicate with you. For example, we may use your Contact Data to let you know when people you know join the application. Except as explicitly provided in these Terms, we will not disclose Personal Information, Message Data or Contact Data to third parties without your consent.
Service Providers.
From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses that we believe are trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (""Service Providers""). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as customer relationship management, and data storage and management. We provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information, Message Data and Contact Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information, Message Data or Contact Data other than as specified by us.
Standard Analytics Information. We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain aggregate or anonymous Usage Data regarding the application. Again, such information does not identify you individually.
Other Transfers.
We may share Personal Information, Usage Data and Message Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with us. If our company is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information, Usage Data and Message Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may therefore disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, Message Data, and any other information about you, if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our Terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to our rights, property or safety, or that of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
Security
We're very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We employ measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the application, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the application, and you do so at your own risk.
Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. By using our Site or Services, you promise that you are at least 13 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. In addition, we recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the application, please send us a detailed message to dancencheung@gmail.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.",

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

Introduction
We do our best to comply with the rapidly changing privacy policies globally. If we are missing something, let us know at rivacypay@ediafiremay.omcay.
MediaFire recognizes and believes that data privacy is essential to all Internet users, and the privacy of your personal information is of the utmost importance to us. We are committed to providing you an experience that is safe, secure, and trustworthy. Part of this commitment means safeguarding and respecting your privacy and your choices.
This Privacy Notice explains what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it, in addition to information on disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information.
Because we’re a technology company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. This Privacy Policy gives you an overview of all possible situations in which we could interact together. Of course, all situations may not apply to you.
This Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Terms of Service, collectively referred to as the ""Agreement"", governs your use of the MediaFire website, Content, apps, software, products, applications, tools and services provided to you on, from, or through the MediaFire website or platform regardless of how your access or use them (collectively, the ""Services""). Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services. “User”, “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting MediaFire’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. “We”, “Us”, and “Ourselves” refers to MediaFire. “Party”, “Parties”, or “Us”, refers to both you and ourselves. It doesn’t matter if the words are capitalized or not. If you choose not to accept this Policy, please do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.
All topics are covered in greater detail below.
Overview
We want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, our legal basis, your rights and the choices that are available to you.
This Privacy Policy incorporates:
Better navigation and user-friendly language. To make the policy easier to understand, we use clear, plain language and examples that illustrate our activities.
Insights into how we acquire your information and how it is used.
More control over your information. We provide intelligence on how you can control the information you provide to us. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information, and the measures we’ve put in place to keep your information secure.
More about using our products for work. Many users have access to our services through their organizations (e.g., their employers), who control their accounts or use of our Services. The updated policy clarifies our relationship to these users and explains the tools available to administrators of these users.
What is Personal and Non Personal Information?
Personally Identifiable Information, commonly referred to as PII, is information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online or device identifier, an identification number, or location data such as your IP address. In relation to your interaction with MediaFire, personal information, for example, may include information you may purposefully provide such as your name and email address during account registration or your address and financial information if you make a purchase. By visiting our website, we automatically collect your IP address. Upon your request and in order for us to download or distribute any Content uploaded by you to MediaFire, your files become published Content and cannot be considered personally identifiable information.
Non-personally identifiable information cannot be used to identify or locate an individual person. Examples are: hashed/anonymized/pseudonymized data, click stream information, browser type, demographics, time and date, which advertisements are clicked or scrolled over and other data of interest.
We will not share personal information about you or any of your Content with any third parties except as described in this Privacy Notice.
Who We Get Information From and How Your Information Is Used
Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you visit MediaFire.
We use your personal information to fulfill our commitment to you and provide you with our Services. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make our Services relevant, interesting and personal to you. We balance our interests with your rights.
How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any choices you have made about information you provide.
Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect from and about you.
You give us information yourself voluntarily, when you:
Create and update an account In order to use certain features, you need to create an account with us. We ask for the bare minimum amount of necessary information - your name and email address, a user ID selected by you, and a, hopefully, complicated and very secure password. Then we assign you a unique identifying number in our database. We use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to communicate with you. Communications may be to onboard you to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. Or, to send you administrative messages and information, notifications about changes to our Services, and updates to our agreements. Additionally, communications could be about Service features, updates, security alerts, technical notices, support and administrative messages, surveys, offers, promotions, events, and provide other news or information which may interest you or other similar messages.
Make a purchase If you purchase a subscription or add-ons, you must provide certain payment and billing data to our payment processing partners, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and zip code. We do store purchase history, billing, and payment confirmation information. We’ll email you invoices confirming your purchase
Contact us directly If you contact us for support or to report a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an account), we collect and store your messages, and other data about you like your name, email address, location, operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we collect through automated means (which we cover below). We use this data to respond to you and research your question or concern.
Interact with our ads Our advertisers gather information when you click on or tap ads or watch videos. The information is used to show you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you and to tailor advertisements across your various devices. Studying ad results helps us make decisions about our customers advertising preferences.
Add names and email addresses to share folders and files To use these features, you provide names and email addresses in order to enable the functionality of the features.
Add people or designate an administrator or billing representative for a business account Companies purchase seats on their account for employees or business associates and provide names and email addresses for the person ‘occupying’ each seat purchased. By necessity, each business account will need to provide contact information for their account administrator and, if different, a billing representative. If you are an individual registered user and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by your employer and was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and your organization wishes to establish a business account, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator or group of users.
Share your information from other companies, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google You may allow transmission of your personal information from companies like these, which may be controlled in the settings of each website, not by MediaFire. MediaFire does not ask for information about you.
Provide information at an event we sponsor or participate in Your name, contact, and possibly other information, may be recorded on our servers.
Your administrator integrates our Services with other services you use To do this, you will need an account.
File a DMCA claim with us When you file a DMCA claim, you provide information about who you are. All the info will be kept on our servers.
Accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy You must accept our agreements in order to use our Services and we record your clicked acceptance.
Apply for a job When a person applies for a job with MediaFire thru our website, all information is recorded and maintained on our servers. Applications received in person or by mail will be manually processed and your name and contact information will be entered into forms stored on our servers.
Our systems and/or third parties may automatically obtain information:
Third-party platforms you connect with An example would be logging into MediaFire from Facebook. We need to ensure it’s you, so information is passed to us. You should review the privacy policies of every website you visit. Websites use cookies to track users and gather information.
Information about your device(s) Information about your IP address, device make, model, operating system, version, and data connection type, and platform, in addition to other specifications and information will be automatically gleaned during contact with our Services. We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to provide updates and other relevant messages related to our Services. These may include information and in-app messages about, new services, new features, etc. Devices are discussed in more detail below.
When you upload, download, collaborate, share files or otherwise interact with our Services These actions also are subject to the next point below – ‘When you interact with our website or mobile app or API’. You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission for others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your company administrator (if applicable) select. Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content. Under certain circumstances, when you share a file, your display name and profile picture may be displayed on that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well. You can confirm whether certain information is visible from within the Services by contacting us or your administrator (if applicable). Please be aware that any Content posted, including information about you, by you or anyone with access to the Content, that Content may be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.
When you interact with our website or mobile app or API MediaFire is always looking for ways to make our Services smarter and faster, and more innovative and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services so we may identify areas for integration and improvement, and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot our Services. To that end, when you interact with us, or really any technology service today, information is gathered to help us fulfill our commitments to you to provide and protect our Services and you. To do that, we need: Information about your behavior on MediaFire: including, login details, date/time of visits, page view data, URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to us, referring/exit pages, click data, features you use, types of advertisements you interact with, duration of your visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access. We use this information to personalize and improve our Services, by analyzing who we appeal to, activity patterns and trends, develop new products and services, and test and analyze new features by providing features to some users before rolling the feature out to all users. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature, we can understand which version is better. Information about your devices plus your browser information, browser history, IP address, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use, your geolocation and system configuration information is recorded. This information can help us identify unique users across multiple devices so we can monitor and analyze traffic and trends and track usage and activities in connection with our Services. We use general location information to provide country based advertising (e.g. US-based advertising, if you are in the US). We also perform studies necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our site and mobile applications, monitor and improve the information security, and to facilitate the Services’ technical functioning, including troubleshooting and resolving issues. Information may be used as required or permitted by law, or as we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.
Other companies give us data:
We may collect info from third party services we contract with We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing and fraud detection, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. We select only well-established and trusted service partners to access information about you to perform services on our behalf.
Information related to your use of third-party services The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services. Have you ever searched for information on a mailbox and then when you visit other websites you see ads for mailboxes? We contract with advertising companies that will use your previous search history and clicks to provide advertising of specific interest to you. Your interests and interactions with ads are not stored on our servers, but we do benefit from this practice. After all, ads help support our website and the experience should be of interest to you.
When you engage in an online survey initiated by us From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve our users, as a whole, by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications and/or promotional activities, and innovations in products and other service offerings we might contemplate.
From a social media website We allow you to use social media sites to create your MediaFire account, sign in to us, or to connect your account with the social media site. Social media sites may give us automatic access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g., content viewed by you, content liked by you, and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on, etc.). To sign in from a social media website, such as Facebook or Twitter, information is shared between us to authenticate your identity. Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you or the platform or service decide to give us. The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are. If you click on a link provided via a social media plugin, you are voluntarily establishing a connection with that respective social media site. Services, like Facebook, give you the option to post information from your account with them. The social media features on our website, like the Facebook Like Button, may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things, such as, your IP address and which page of our Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature (e.g. Like Button). Your interactions with these features are governed by the social media’s own privacy policy. You should be aware that any information you provide on social media websites, community forums and publicly accessible blogs, including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information, may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.
Device Information
We automatically receive certain types of information when you install, access, update, or use our Services. This information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's unique identifier, manufacturer and model, operating system and version, screen size and resolution, mobile network and status (WiFi, etc.), application version including installation and updates info, settings, and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
We use this information to determine what types and version of devices, etc. are accessing our Services. After all, we have to write software to accommodate various platforms, versions, etc. We have to keep up and necessarily sunset unused code.
This Privacy Policy governs your use of the MediaFire Services, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage and disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. Information may be collected from you in various ways when you use our Services. We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, apps, services and communications. This information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's IP address, access times, your browser type and language. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and accessed pages. Personal and non-personally identifiable information from collected data may be shared with third parties who work on our behalf to provide your services. These third-party services and unique identifiers may be used to contact you, measure usage and analyze trends, administer the website and collect information for its databases. For example: Google Analytics Privacy Policy.
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
What are they?
When you interact with people, it’s nice when they remember you, your relationship and what you like. That ‘feel good’ experience has been extended to your interactions with websites.
Like most browsers and websites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files saved on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our site, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.
MediaFire and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons when you access and use our Services. These tools are essential to enable the Services to provide the features you have requested, such as remembering you have logged in. These tools also automatically track and collect certain system data and usage data when you use our Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through these tools to other data that we collect.
These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. The specific names and types of cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and similar technologies used to collect and manage information may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand our use of such technologies, we have provided the some terminology and definitions.
Cookies are mutually beneficial small text files, which often include a unique identifier, placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. They are commonly used to remember where you were during your session with a website. They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites. Cookies allow us to recognize you, remember things about your visits, make our site easier to use, see which areas and features are popular and count visits to our website. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. There are several types of cookies:
Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow sites to link your actions during that particular browser session. They help with navigation on a website and are enabled by default.
Persistent cookies are stored on your device and record information, allowing sites to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites. They remain until you manually delete them or until they expire.
First-party cookies are created by the website you are visiting and are necessary to keep track of your personal preferences and the current session. Most web browsers enable first-party cookies by default. If you were to disable first-party cookies, a website could not keep track of your activity as you move from page to page.
Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting. These are commonly used for advertising, analytics, etc.
Flash cookies aka Local Shared Objects (“LSO”) are a small file stored on your computer by a website that uses Adobe’s Flash player technology. Information stored on a Flash cookie is available to all browsers and is considered a security issue. When you delete or clear cookies from your browser, you will not necessarily delete the Flash cookies stored on your computer. MediaFire does not use Flash cookies.
Web beacons are small graphic images (also known as ""pixel tags"" or ""clear GIFs"") that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behavior. There are myriad ways in which they can be used. For example, a third-party tracking site can determine how much merchandise was purchased for a particular banner ad campaign. In scenarios such as these, the individual users may still remain anonymous, even though their buying habits are disclosed.
Mobile device identifiers - When you access mobile applications, companies don’t have access to traditional browser cookies to track you over time. Instead, third party advertising and analytics companies use device identifiers, such as Apple iOS’s Identifiers for Advertisers and Google Android’s Advertising ID, to monitor the different applications used on a particular device.
Device fingerprinting can track devices over time, based on your browser’s configurations and settings. Because each browser is unique, device fingerprinting can identify your device, without using cookies. Since device fingerprinting uses the characteristics of your browser configuration to track you, deleting cookies won’t help. Device fingerprinting technologies are evolving and can be used to track you on all kinds of internet-connected devices that have browsers, such as smart phones, tablets, laptop and desktop computers.
HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser. And, it can generally be used as an alternative to Adobe Flash. It isn't proprietary and it is cross-platform, which means it doesn't care whether you're using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or ultrabook or a Smart TV. If your browser supports HTML5, it should work flawlessly.
Why does MediaFire use these technologies?
MediaFire and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience, increased functionality and to recognize you across different services and devices.
We use these cookies both when you visit our site and Services via a browser and our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.
Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent). You are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device allows this, but if you disable them, then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable. You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.

Third-party websites or services linked to MediaFire are not covered by this Privacy Policy. MediaFire is not responsible for the privacy practices of the third-party websites and companies or what they do with your information. You should make sure their privacy policy is acceptable to you. These websites may collect personally and non-personally identifiable information about you utilizing cookies, web beacons, log data analysis, API, SDK, JavaScript, pixels or other technologies or methods and place cookies on your browser in order to provide advertisement about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about behavioral advertising practices or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info and Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. You will still see ads if you opt out of behavioral advertising but the ads will be less relevant to you. Also note that deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences.
Data Retention
Account holder information is held by MediaFire in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
MediaFire takes your privacy seriously and is not in the business of tracking you; we are in the business of helping you store, share, and access your data. We work hard to collect the minimum information possible to facilitate a great user experience with the powerful features you use on our website, mobile apps, and other associated platforms.
MediaFire’s Data Retention Policy can be viewed at https://www.mediafire.com/policies/data_retention.php
Revoke Consent
In order to access your account and files, MediaFire must have information about you in order to identify you. Revoking consent to collection and retention of your personal data effectively closes your account with MediaFire. You can submit a ticket to customer support to request deletion of your account. See our Data Retention Policy for more information.
California Privacy
When you access MediaFire from California, you will receive a notification ""Do Not Sell My Personal Information"". If you click on that notification, you will then receive an option to Dismiss or Opt out.
For more information, MediaFire’s California Privacy Policy can be viewed at
https://www.mediafire.com/policies/california_privacy.php

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.

The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

Third parties that process your personal data are contractually bound by Data Processing Agreements which ensure that these parties adhere to the standards that we describe in this Privacy Policy.
Do we participate in interest-based advertising programs?
Yes. We may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser when you access or use some of our Sites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising”). We also allow third-party companies to place their own cookies on your browser when you visit our Sites, so that they can collect information, which may include personal information, about your online activities over time and across different sites and serve customized advertisements to you as you browse the Internet. You will find a detailed description of what personal data we transmit to such third parties in the section “How and with whom do we share and disclose information we collect from you?” above.
These third party companies may participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance. As part of this program, targeted advertisements may be delivered with an AdChoices icon to help you understand how data about you is being used and provide you with the ability to opt-out of that behaviorally targeted advertising. You can click on an AdChoices icon to learn more about your choices with respect to interest-based advertising. From a mobile device, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices website to download a free app that allows you to set preferences for data collection and use across mobile apps. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative by visiting the opt-out page on their website.
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that allows you to tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Only certain of our Sites are currently set up to respond to these signals, however, for Sites not set up to respond to a “do not track” preference, you have other choices and options as described in this Privacy Policy regarding our different types of advertising and electronic marketing-related communications.
We use NextRoll, Inc. (formerly, AdRoll, Inc.) to serve targeted advertisements. For California consumers, please see the CCPA disclosures set forth in Section 13 of NextRoll’s Service Privacy Notice.
What other technologies do we use?
Clear gifs
Some or our Sites employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage our content and newsletters by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and in E-mails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

Version as of April 2022
Introduction
We, TeamViewer SE, take protection of your personal data very seriously. The following notice provides an overview of how we ensure this protection and what kind of data is processed, and why. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, for example your name, address, email addresses, number of shares, the information which intermediary bank you are using.
A. Controller
TeamViewer SE, Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, [email protected], is controller of your personal data pursuant to Art. 4 para. 7 General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
B. Data Protection Officer (DPO)
TeamViewer SE appointed Ms. Katja Hauser as external data protection officer, who can be reached at [email protected], or at intersoft consulting services AG, DSB TeamViewer, Dürener Str. 189, 50931 Cologne.
C. Purpose of processing and respective legal basis
TeamViewer SE collects and processes different categories of personal data depending on the relevant purpose of the use, especially in connection with the management of investor and shareholder relations. The following sections outline the categories of data processed by us and respective purposes for such processing. If the legal basis for a processing is your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, such withdrawal however will not have any impact on the legitimacy of the processing itself prior to withdrawal of your consent.
I. Management of investor relations
We may process your personal data collected at the events or roadshows, such as your name and contact information, as well as in connection with our Investor Relations News Alert (in case you have subscribed to it) or if you decide to get in touch with us via email or phone. Legal basis for the processing is your consent, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (a) GDPR or our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to answer your questions, provide information and maintain our investor relations.
II. Processing of personal data of shareholders and their representative
We may process your personal data such as your name, contact information, your email address, your representative, your intermediary bank, number of shares in connection with you purchasing shares in TeamViewer SE. Such information is used to fulfil our legal obligations (e.g. inform the regulatory bodies if shareholders reach certain levels of share ownership) as well as organize annual shareholder meetings (“Shareholder Meeting”), including but not limited to preparing and sending out the invitations, issuing voting cards or respectively voting right tickets, compiling the list of participants and processing the power of attorneys. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.
III. Processing of personal data in connection with Shareholder Meetings
We may conduct our Shareholder Meetings either in person or without presence using the means of remote communication (“virtual Shareholder Meeting”) with the option of participating by an electronic connection.
In order to enable shareholders and their representatives to participate in the Shareholder Meeting (e.g. by checking their eligibility to participate) and to exercise their rights at the Shareholder Meeting (including granting and revoking powers of attorney and instructions) as well as to ensure a proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting, the observance of voting bans, the lawful adoption of resolutions and evaluation of cast votes at the Shareholder Meeting, we may process the name, contact information, registration number, number of shares, voting behavior and results, submitted questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations, instructions and objections of our shareholders and their representatives, and login information for our designated shareholder portal (shareholder/voting card number and password). Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.
The entire Shareholder Meeting may be broadcast live and publicly accessible on the Internet by means of video and audio transmission. If the Shareholder Meeting is conducted in person and you enter the recording area or make a verbal contribution during recording activities, this live broadcast will include your appearance and verbal contribution. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to enable interested shareholders and the public to follow the Shareholder Meeting via the Internet in accordance with the express permission in the German Stock Corporation Act and our by-laws.
Insofar as we take down in shorthand your verbal contributions during the Shareholder Meeting without being legally obliged to do so, this is done to ensure the proper conduct of the Shareholder Meeting and to be able to deal with your questions and motions. The stenographic minutes will not be published. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to ensure that the Shareholder Meeting is executed properly and that our shareholders’ participation rights can be realized in the best possible way.
If you make use of the opportunity to submit questions, statements (in writing or via video message), motions, counter-motions, nominations or other requests that are dealt with or made available during or before the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name, which other participants of the Shareholder Meeting may take note of. If we are not legally obliged to state your name in this context, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest is to inform the other shareholders of the name of the applicant.
IV. Processing of personal data in connection with the shareholder portal
If we conduct the Shareholder Meeting virtually, the shareholders and their representatives will not be able to physically attend the meeting. They can, however, follow the entire meeting via video and audio transmission through the designated shareholder portal. In connection with the virtual Shareholder Meeting we will process your voting card number, log-in password, type of the power of attorney and personal data of your representative, as well as the instructions issued in connection with the Shareholder Meeting and any other information submitted by you in the shareholder portal. Legal basis for the processing is the legal obligation under stock corporation law to which we are a subject to, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (c) GDPR.
If we conduct a virtual Shareholder Meeting and provide the shareholder portal to enable you to conveniently manage your shareholder data, we will collect and process certain personal data on the web server log files, when you visit our shareholder portal in order to log in to attend the virtual Shareholder Meeting, manage your shareholder data or exercise your shareholder’s rights:
Date and time of the request
Notification whether the request was successful
Requested URL
Referrer URL (the previously visited page), if your browser sends this information
Type of used web browser and operating system used
IP address
Port by which the access was made
Actions performed within the portal
Session ID and data
Successful logins and logouts with the time stamp
Your browser automatically transfers this data to us when you visit our shareholder portal.
Legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest, Art. 6, para. 1 lit (f) GDPR, since we have a legitimate interest in making the shareholder portal available to you and your representatives so that you can exercise your shareholder rights in a user-friendly manner and participate in the virtual Shareholder Meeting.
D. Cookies
If we use cookies in the provision of the shareholder portal, we will only do so if this is necessary for the operation of the shareholder portal or if you have given your consent. In this case, when you visit the shareholder portal, we will inform you in a pop-up window about our cookies and associated data processing before using cookies and, if necessary, ask you for your voluntary consent.
E. Data Sources
If you are a shareholder, we receive your personal data either directly from you or from the custodian credit institutions or intermediaries who are involved in the deposit of shares you purchased.
If you act as representative of a shareholder, we receive your personal data from the shareholder who granted you the power of attorney and directly from you as far as your behavior during the Shareholder Meeting or your use of the shareholder portal is concerned.
F. Recipients
TeamViewer SE’s employees, who administer, maintain and manage our internal processes, will have access to your personal data. To that end, TeamViewer SE has strong technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized disclosure to third parties and to ensure that only relevant individuals, who act within their job description and have a need-to-know interest in accessing any of your personal data, will have access to the data for which they have sufficient clearance.
Aside from TeamViewer SE’s employees, your personal data may be processed by employees of third-party services providers, who assist us in our daily business, such as providers of IT operation and maintenance services, (cloud) storage service providers and providers of (cloud) collaboration tools, as well as PR agencies. We use certain service providers in order to provide services typical for the capital market, such as EQS Group AG and Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. for the management of investor relations as well as Link Market Services GmbH for the management of shareholder relations and Shareholder Meetings. Link Market Services GmbH also operates the shareholder portal used for organizing virtual Shareholder Meetings, exclusively on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.
TeamViewer SE selects all third-party service providers with due care, obligates them to confidentiality, and concludes data processing agreements (DPAs) with them (including the providers listed above) in accordance with the standards of the GDPR, as applicable. Should you have any questions about third parties we use, please contact us at [email protected].
In addition to above cases, your personal data may also be disclosed during or in connection with the Shareholder Meetings. If you, as a shareholder, make use of the opportunity to submit questions and your questions are dealt with during the Shareholder Meeting, this will generally be done by stating your name. The above applies likewise regarding the submission of statements (in writing or via video message), the publication of which will show your name and, in the case of a statement via video message, images of yourself. If you submit items for the agenda, motions, counter-motions or nominations that we have to make publicly available, e.g. on our company’s website, before the Shareholder Meeting pursuant to our obligations under stock corporation law, this will also generally be done by stating your name. Other participants of the Shareholder Meeting or even the public may take note of this. Furthermore, other shareholders, their representatives where applicable or other participants of the meeting can view the personal data contained in the participant list during the Shareholder Meeting and, if applicable, up to two years thereafter in accordance with Sec. 129 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
TeamViewer SE will generally not transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, which include data transfers for group internal IT services provided from outside the EU, including Australia, USA and Armenia. TeamViewer SE will otherwise transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or EEA only when required to do so by law or in case of orders from a competent authority. Currently we transfer personal data to our provider Nasdaq Corporate Solutions International Ltd. in the US. Legal basis for such transfer is a DPA with EU standard contractual clauses.
Whenever TeamViewer SE transfers your personal data out of the EU or the EEA to countries that do not have an adequate level of data protection recognized by the EU, we will apply safeguards to adequately protect your personal data. In particular, we will conclude standard contractual clauses with corresponding entities and /. Please refer to https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en to obtain further information on the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established outside the EU or the EEA.
We will not share your personal data with local authorities or courts except where we are required to do so by applicable law, a court order or a legally binding injunction. We may be obliged to pass on your personal data to other recipients, such as when publishing voting rights notifications in accordance with the provisions of the German Securities Trading Act, or to authorities in order to comply with statutory notification obligations (e.g. to financial or criminal prosecution authorities).
G. Retention periods for personal data
Your personal data will be deleted once you withdraw consent, or once the purpose for processing has ceased to exist. In some cases, TeamViewer SE is legally obligated to retain data for a certain period of time. Your personal data will be deleted or anonymized as soon as they are no longer required for the purposes listed under Section C. and if the deleting or anonymizing does not conflict with legal requirements for proof and storage.
H. Statutory/contractual requirement
You may choose not to provide your personal data or provide incomplete personal data. However, by not providing your personal data, we may not be able to provide you with the relevant service or support, e.g. enable you to participate in our Shareholder Meeting or use all of the functionalities of our website; where we ask for consent and you choose not to provide it, or you block, disable or delete cookies, we may not be able to provide you with the information or service requested.
I. Your rights

Security
We take all reasonable technical and organisational measures in order to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access and any other unlawful forms of processing.
Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure.

Notice of Changes
If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication on our webpage. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances and, where required under applicable law, ask for your consent.
Your Rights
You have the right to, at any time, receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and information about the processing.
You have the right to, without undue delay, have incorrect or irrelevant personal data about you corrected and taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data about you completed.
You have the right to have your personal data deleted without undue delay and we are obliged to delete your personal data without undue delay if, for example one of the following grounds applies: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or if you withdraw consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. Please note that we are not obliged to delete the personal data if we can show that the processing is necessary, for example, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Instabridge is subject, such as book-keeping rules or the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim, or when there are other legitimate grounds to keep the data.
Furthermore, you have the right to request that Instabridge restricts the processing of your personal data under certain conditions, for example if you contest the accuracy of the personal data, the processing may be restricted for a period enabling Instabridge to verify the accuracy of the personal data or if Instabridge no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing but you require the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to Instabridge’s processing of your personal data if the processing is based on, for example, legitimate interests, including marketing and/or profiling based on a legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, Instabridge will no longer be entitled to process your personal data based on such legal basis, unless Instabridge can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights and freedom or if it is conducted for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.
You have, under certain conditions, the right to receive the personal data concerning you and which you have provided to Instabridge, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such personal data to another data controller without Instabridge trying to prevent this, where Instabridge’s processing of your personal data is based on your consent or on a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means. You have in such case the right to request that the personal data from Instabridge shall be transmitted directly to another data controller, where technically feasible.
You also have the right to, at any time, withdraw your consent given to Instabridge for the processing of your personal data e.g. for marketing purposes. If you withdraw your consent, please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal and that Instabridge may, under certain circumstances, have another legal ground for the processing and therefore may be entitled to continue the processing.
If you are unhappy with our processing of your personal data and/or consider it to be in contrary to applicable legislation you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory data protection authority (“DPA”) (such as with the DPA in your country of residence, the DPA in the country of your place of work or the DPA in the country where the alleged infringement has occurred).
To exercise the aforementioned rights please contact us at the following address: support@degoo.com or Degoo Backup AB, Vasagatan 16, 111 20 Stockholm.

Summary
A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:
Maps app. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.
You can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services (for example, Cortana). For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.
Camera app. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.
When the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu.
Photos app. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.
The updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.
The Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.
The People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.
When enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping.
If you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.
People app. The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.
Mail and Calendar app. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app.
Messaging app. When you sign in with a Microsoft account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your Microsoft account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your Microsoft account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message. Location information will be collected by Microsoft as described in the Windows Location services section of this privacy statement.
Narrator. Narrator is a screen-reading app that helps you use Windows without a screen. Narrator offers intelligent image and page title description and web page summaries when you encounter undescribed images and ambiguous links.
When you choose to get an image description by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the image will be sent to Microsoft to perform analysis of the image and generate a description. Images are used only to generate the description and are not stored by Microsoft.
When you choose to get page title descriptions by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + D, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the page title description and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing services as described in the Bing section above.
When you choose to get a list of popular links for a web page by pressing Narrator + double press of S, the URL of the site you are visiting will be sent to Microsoft to generate the summary of popular links and to provide and improve Microsoft services, such as Bing.
You can disable these features at any time by going to Narrator > Get image descriptions, page titles and popular links in the Windows setting app.
You can also send feedback about Narrator to help Microsoft diagnose and resolve problems with Narrator and improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows. Verbal feedback can be submitted at any time in Narrator by using Narrator Key + Alt + F. When you use this command, the Feedback Hub app will launch, giving you the opportunity to submit verbal feedback. If you enable the setting “Help Make Narrator Better” in the Windows settings app and submit verbal feedback through Feedback Hub, recent device and usage data, including event trace log (ETL) data, will be submitted along with your verbal feedback to improve Microsoft products and services, such as Windows.
Live captions. Live captions transcribe audio to help with the comprehension of spoken content. Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.
Voice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions.",

This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Platform to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Platform from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.
When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.
To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).
Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay
When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.
Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.
You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.
Personal data relating to third parties
If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.
Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools
All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our User Agreement (including any of our rules and policies), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.
This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our User Agreement and our other rules and policies (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay.
Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?
Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfill our legal ""Know Your Customer"" (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.
Children's Privacy
Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.
Staying Signed in
When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:

You are solely responsible for all information that you submit to Gumtree and any consequences that may result from your post. We reserve the right at our discretion to refuse or delete content that we believe is inappropriate or breaching the above terms. We also reserve the right at our discretion to restrict a user's usage of Gumtree either temporarily or permanently, or refuse a user's registration. If we believe that you are breaching these Terms of Use in any way and/or behaving suspiciously on Gumtree, we may, at our discretion, inform other Gumtree users that have been in contact with you and recommend that they exercise caution.
Abusing Gumtree
Gumtree and the Gumtree community work together to keep Gumtree working properly and the community safe. Please report problems, offensive content and policy breaches to us using the reporting system.
Without limiting other remedies, we may issue warnings, limit or terminate our service, remove hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off Gumtree if we think that they are creating problems, infringing the rights of third parties or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (including, without limitation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or harassing the Gumtree employees or other users). However, whether we decide to take any of these steps, remove hosted content or keep a user off Gumtree or not, we do not have any obligation to monitor the information transmitted or stored on Gumtree and we do not accept any liability for unauthorised or unlawful content on Gumtree or use of Gumtree by users.
Global Marketplace
Some of Gumtree's features may display your ad on other sites, services, applications or tools (together a “Platform”) that are part of the Gumtree community, or on third party Platforms, including social media channels. By using Gumtree, you agree that your ads can be displayed on these other Platforms and media channels. You may be subject to additional laws or other restrictions in the countries where your ad is posted. When your ad is posted on another Platform, you may be responsible for ensuring that it does not violate such other Platform's policies. We may remove your ad if it is reported on Gumtree, or any third party Platform, or if we believe it causes problems or violates any law or policy.
Fees and Services
Using Gumtree is generally free, but we sometimes charge a fee for certain services. If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in Pounds Sterling, and we may change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to our fee policy by posting such changes on Gumtree. We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service.
You are responsible for paying the Gumtree fees when they're due. If you don't, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may be entitled to under these Terms of Use or by law, we may limit your ability to use the services. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms.
You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from Gumtree in case we believe these Terms of Use, including our Posting Rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly. In case you would have paid a fee for the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee. However, we reserve the right not to refund Gumtree users for any fees paid through use of Gumtree in the following cases:
If you breach, in our opinion, these Terms of Use, which include, without limitation, the Policies;
If your ads went live with exposure on the Gumtree sites, services, applications or tools, even for a limited time, and that they benefited from the service associated with the paid fee;
If your ads are placed in the Pets or Massage categories of Gumtree;
If your ads are placed into ""edit"" mode and will go live to site once updated by you;
If you have removed your ads yourself;
If you post duplicate ads as defined in our rules regarding duplicate ads;
If we believe that your ads are in a significantly wrong category;
Please note that the above list is not exhaustive. See the Gumtree Refunds Help Page for more details on the cases in which you may, or may not, be entitled to a refund of such fees.
In addition to the Gumtree services, ancillary goods or services such as insurance or car finance may be advertised on Gumtree. Although users may offer financial products on their ads, Gumtree is in no way involved or liable for any loss related to such transactions.
Display and placement of user ads
We strive to create a community where users can find what they are looking for. Therefore, the appearance or placement of ads in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
users' location and search query / category selected;
adverts' category, content, location and date published; and
if the ad has a paid-for promotion (see our Payment & Promotions Help page for more information)
Content
Gumtree contains content from us, you, and other users. Gumtree is protected by copyright laws and international treaties. Content displayed on or via Gumtree is protected as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to copyrights laws and international conventions. You agree not to copy, distribute or modify content from Gumtree without our express written consent. You may not disassemble or decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover any source code contained in Gumtree. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree not to reproduce, copy, sell, resell, or exploit for any purposes any aspect of Gumtree (other than your own content). When you give us content, you grant us and represent that you have the right to grant us, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise any and all copyright, publicity, trademarks, design, database and intellectual property rights to that content, in any media whether now known or to be discovered in the future including, without limitation, on any third party Platforms and media channels. In particular, by giving us content, you grant us the right to display such content on Platforms that are part of the Gumtree corporate group, and on other online marketplaces, social media channels, blogs, in all types of marketing communications and on all other Platforms. In addition, you waive all moral rights you have in the content to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Gumtree may at times use third party data suppliers to supplement the information you have provided in an ad. This could include descriptions, product specifications and other content. You may use such information solely in connection with your Gumtree ad while your ad is on Gumtree. The information provided may be subject to copyright, trademark and/or other protections. You agree not to remove any such protected information and/or create any derivative works based on the content (other than by including them in your ads).This permission is subject to modification or revocation at any time at Gumtree's sole discretion.
You may not have the opportunity to review all of the supplemental data before posting an ad. Gumtree is not responsible for the accuracy of any third party supplied supplemental data. You continue to be responsible for ensuring that your ads are accurate, do not include misleading information and fully comply with these Terms of Use and all Gumtree policies. If you notice inaccuracies in this data after your ad appears on the site please get in touch with us.
Infringement
Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties. This includes, but is not limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyright, design and trademark (e.g. offering counterfeit items for sale). A large number of products of all sorts are offered on Gumtree by private individuals. Entitled parties, in particular owners of copyright, trademark rights or other rights can report any advertisement which may infringe on their rights, and submit a request for such advertisement to be removed. If a legal representative of the entitled party reports this to us in the correct manner, products infringing on the intellectual property rights will be removed by Gumtree.
Reporting an infringement:
In order to participate in the Notice of Infringement Programme, you only need to complete a Notice of Infringement Form and email it to Gumtree at noticeandtakedown@gumtree.com. You can use this form, complete with your signature, to report advertisements which may infringe on your property rights. The information requested in the Notice of Infringement Form is for the purpose of ensuring that the parties reporting these objects are either the entitled party or their officially authorised representative. This information must also enable Gumtree to identify the advertisement to be removed. Once we have received your correctly completed Notice of Infringement Form, you can simply send later reports to Gumtree via the e-mail address provided.
Note: This form can only be used by the lawful owners of the relevant intellectual property rights. The ""Notice of Infringement"" is intended to enable rights owners to ensure that products offered by Gumtree users do not infringe their copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights. For all other questions, visitors and advertisers can get help using Gumtree Help.
Liability
Nothing in these terms shall limit our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, or for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do.
We do not review users' postings and are not involved in the actual transactions between users. As most of the content on Gumtree comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what's offered.
In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offence, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.
You acknowledge that we cannot guarantee continuous, error-free or secure access to our services or that defects in the service will be corrected. While we will use reasonable efforts to maintain an uninterrupted service, we cannot guarantee this and we do not give any promises or warranties (whether express or implied) about the operation and availability of our sites, services, applications or tools.
Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted we expressly disclaim all warranties, representations and conditions, express or implied, including those of quality, merchantability, merchantable quality, durability, fitness for a particular purpose and those arising by statute. We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of, or inability to use Gumtree, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 Pounds Sterling.
Release
If you have a dispute with one or more Gumtree users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known or unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
Third party rights
A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any Terms of Use but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party specified in this Agreement or which exists or is available apart from that Act.
Data Protection and Privacy
By using Gumtree, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage and use of your personal information by Gumtree on servers located in the Netherlands, United States and China as further described in our Privacy Notice.
You and Gumtree shall process personal data received under and/or in connection with these Terms of Use each as a separate and independent controller. In no event will Gumtree and you process personal data under and/or in connection with this User Agreement as joint controllers or in a controller-to-processor relationship. As such separate and independent controllers, you shall be individually and separately responsible for complying with the obligations that apply to you as a controller under applicable data protection law.
You shall comply with your obligations under applicable data protection law (including but not limited to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (EU General Data Protection Regulation “GDPR”)) and supplementing EU and local data protection law. This includes, but is not limited to the obligation to provide appropriate safeguards for the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation. You shall process personal data received from Gumtree exclusively for the purpose(s) you received the personal data under and/or in connection with these Terms of Use. You shall erase the personal data received under these Terms of Use immediately after the respective purpose(s) has/have been fulfilled. Any further processing of the personal data is not permitted except when legally required (e.g., if a retention obligation applies).
Failure to abide with the aforementioned obligations may result in disciplinary action up to and including account suspension.
As part of the services, Gumtree has access to various information about users, including personal data. This includes information that users submit to Gumtree as part of the services (such as contact information or item descriptions) as well as information that is generated by the provision and processing of the services (such as ratings, sales analysis or communication).
Via Gumtree.com and its related websites, services, applications or tools, you receive information which is necessary for the processing of transactions (in particular, the contact information of the other user involved in a transaction) as well as aggregated information on the performance and analysis of your ads, which are partly related to the data of other users of the services (such as number of impressions of an ad, conversion rate or return rate).
Gumtree only shares information about users with third parties if this is necessary for the provision of the services or if Gumtree is legally or contractually entitled to do so.
Upon expiry of these Terms of Use, we will delete the information you provided, or which was generated through your use of the services from your Gumtree account. Regardless, we maintain this information after the expiry of these Terms of Use if we are legally obliged or have a legitimate interest to do so. We will generally maintain aggregated data generated using the services (e.g. statistics about ads in a category) upon expiry of these Terms of Use.
For information regarding the processing of personal data by Gumtree, including sharing such data with third parties and your rights as a data subject, please see our Privacy Notice.
Resolution of disputes
If a dispute arises between you and Gumtree, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by going to the Gumtree Help page. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.
General
These terms and the other policies posted on Gumtree constitute the entire agreement between Gumtree and you, superseding any prior agreements. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in all respects by the laws of England and Wales. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Gumtree.com Limited must be resolved by the courts of England and Wales. You and Gumtree both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts; for claims falling within the jurisdiction of a County Court, you and Gumtree both agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the County Court of Wandsworth.
If we don't enforce any particular provision, we are not waiving our right to do so later. If a court strikes down any of these terms, the remaining terms will survive. We may automatically assign this agreement in our sole discretion in accordance with the notice provision below.
Except for notices relating to illegal or infringing content, your notices to us must be sent by registered mail to Gumtree.com Limited, 27 Old Gloucester Street, London, WC1N 3AX, United Kingdom. We will send notices to you via the email address you provide, or by registered mail. Notices sent by registered mail will be deemed received five days following the date of mailing.
We may update this agreement at any time, with updates taking effect when you next post or 30 days after we post the updated policy on the Gumtree website, whichever is sooner. No other amendment to this agreement will be effective unless made in writing, signed by users and by us.

13.- CIERRE DEL SERVICIO TIENDEO CASHBACK
A.- EL SERVICIO CASHBACK Y SU FINALIZACIÓN
A través de la Aplicación, y en su caso a través de la página web www.TIENDEO.com, TIENDEO ha puesto a disposición de sus Usuarios un servicio de incentivos económicos por la compra de productos promocionales, publicados en la Aplicación por fabricantes y marcas de consumo. TIENDEO ha permitido a sus Usuarios ganar dinero al comprar determinados productos (publicados por los Socios en la Aplicación o por TIENDEO) cuya compra tiene asociada una recompensa económica, una ""Promo"".
TIENDEO ha decidido poner fin al Servicio Cashback. Por lo tanto, a partir de ahora, TIENDEO ya no proporcionará a sus Usuarios incentivos económicos por la compra de productos promocionales y ya no existirán, en la Aplicación y en el sitio web, productos promocionales que permitan a los Usuarios ganar dinero al comprarlos.
B.- PLAZO DE DEVOLUCIÓN
Hasta el 30 de abril de 2023, los Usuarios tendrán la posibilidad de canjear el saldo de Cashback acumulado hasta el día de hoy.
Si el Usuario ha alcanzado el importe mínimo de reembolso (por favor, consulte el siguiente párrafo a este respecto) pero no reembolsa el saldo de cashback antes del 30 de abril de 2023, perderá todo derecho sobre dicho saldo.
Después del 30 de abril de 2023, los Usuarios no podrán acceder a su cuenta de Cashback.
C.- MODALIDADES DE REEMBOLSO
Si el saldo del Usuario es igual o superior al importe mínimo de reembolso, entendiendo por tal el importe igual o superior al mínimo indicado entre los métodos de reembolso, el Usuario podrá canjear su crédito. El crédito acumulado en la Cuenta de Usuario TIENDEO carece de valor, monetario o de cualquier otra naturaleza, si no ha alcanzado el mínimo descrito anteriormente.
Dentro del 30 de abril de 2023, los Usuarios podrán canjear su saldo según las modalidades de reembolso vigentes que son:
Directo:
- Paypal (a partir de 10€)
- Transferencia bancaria (desde 5€)
Tarjeta regalo:
- Amazon (5€, 10€ o 20€)
- Decathlon (10€)
Donación:
- Médicos sin fronteras (5€, 10€, 20€ o 50€)
- Amnistía internacional (5€, 10€, 20€ o 50€)
- Fundació Mona (5€, 10€, 20€ o 50€)
- Movember (5€)
Excepcionalmente y con el fin de que los Usuarios puedan canjear su crédito dado que terceros no conceden tarjetas regalo o permitan donaciones por un valor entre 5€ y 10€, TIENDEO ha decidido permitir a los Usuarios elegir los métodos de transferencia bancaria para saldos superiores a 5€ e inferiores a 10€.
D.- DATOS PERSONALES
Tras la finalización del Servicio Cashback, los datos personales facilitados por los Usuarios con la única finalidad de participar en dicho servicio (incluyendo número de móvil, información de la cuenta bancaria, cuenta PayPal y dirección de correo electrónico, si esta última es distinta a la utilizada para el login) serán conservados por TIENDEO durante los plazos legalmente establecidos para la formulación, ejercicio o defensa de posibles reclamaciones y posteriormente serán suprimidos, salvo que exista causa que justifique su conservación.

If you have a good faith belief that a listing on any of the Services infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, all you need to do is download our Notice of Claimed Infringement (NOCI) form, fill it out, and email it to Kijiji at the email address provided on the form. After we receive your first NOCI, Kijiji will confirm your enrolment in our program. We reserve the right to share, in accordance with applicable law, the completed NOCI form with the third party that originally posted the potentially infringing listing.
Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability. The Services are provided “as is” and “as available”. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do. You also agree not to hold us responsible for the payment processing of other service providers such as Adyen (each a “Third Party Payment Processor”.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.
Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you pay to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 Canadian Dollars.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, but doing so will not excuse your indemnity obligations.

Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.
Information you give us
You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:
· When you create an account, you provide us with at least your phone number and email address, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender, date of birth, and who you’d like to connect with.
· When you complete your profile, you have the option to share your sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religious beliefs with us. Where you provide such elements to us, you consent to us using it for the purposes identified and as laid out in this Privacy Policy. You can also share additional information with us, such as details on your bio and your interests, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
· When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us with information related to the purchases you make and our payment processors with information such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.
· When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.
· When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.
· If you contact us (for example, through our customer care team or on social media), we collect the information you give us during the interaction.
· If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.
· Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish to operate and secure the services, and to keep our community safe.
Information we receive from others
In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:
· Users
Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.
· Social media
You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create or log into your Plenty of Fish account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information, such as photos from one of your social media accounts (for example, Facebook or Instagram).
· Other partners
We may receive information about you from our partners where our ads are published on a partner’s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our users’ safety and security.
Information generated or automatically collected when you use our services
When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details.
· Usage information
Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (for example, when you logged in, features you’ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (for example, users you connect and interact with, and when you matched and exchanged messages with them).
· Device information
We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’s settings and, in some cases, disable entirely), and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.
· Information collected by cookies and similar technologies:
We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (for example, web beacons, pixels and SDKs) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read Section 4 and our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Plenty of Fish, do not currently respond to DNT signals.
· Other information with your consent
· Precise geolocation data: If you give us your consent, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) from your device. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it, and our services that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.

Additional Information about Advertising
We may publish ads about third-party advertisers’ products and services on our service and publish ads promoting our own service on third-party sites and apps. To help improve the relevance of these ads, we provide certain info about you (such as device information and identifiers like your IP address and advertising identifiers, usage information like links clicked and conversion information, and demographic information like your age, gender and interests) to third parties, including advertising partners, or allow them to collect such information from our services (such as via cookies, SDKs, or similar technologies). Some of our advertising partners enable us to transform your email address, advertising identifiers or phone number into an identifier that can’t be used to identify you personally and then use that unique identifier to either exclude you from our marketing campaigns, or to target our ads at an audience that is similar to you in terms of background, interests or app usage. If you live in the United States, some of the activities described in this section may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under applicable laws, and we give you the choice to opt-out, as described in Section 8. In other countries, we may ask you to opt into these activities. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.
To process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:
· Provide our service to you: The reason we process your information for purposes A and B above is to perform the contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features to you and other users.
· Legitimate interests: We process your information for purposes C, D and E above, based on our legitimate interest. For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our users safe and we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a legal action.
· Comply with applicable laws and regulations: We process your information for purpose F above where it is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement. We also keep data evidencing consents users give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.
· Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you’re consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific information such as your precise geolocation or use your information for certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in relation to the collection of precise geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered “special” or “sensitive”). In any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We also share some types of users’ information in connection with the activities explained in Section 4 above and with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.
· With other users
You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being visible.
If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.
If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that you violated our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines), we may communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.
· With our service providers and partners
We share information with vendors who help us operate, distribute, market and improve our services, such as data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.
We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any vendor or working with any partner. Our vendors and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.
· For corporate transactions
We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.
· With law enforcement / when required by law
We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
· To enforce legal rights
We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.
· With your consent or at your request
We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.
We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, location in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances.
POF is part of the Match Group family of businesses.
We may share information about you with our affiliates and they may share information about you with us, for the reasons laid out below:
· To make all Match Group platforms safer, for instance by making sure that when a bad actor is found on one Match Group platform (for instance ours), they can be banned from all.
· To assist each other in data processing operations, as processors. This assistance may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and advertising, analytics, finance and accounting, payment processing, service improvement, data security and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.
· To improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities. We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse.
· If you are located in the USA excluding California, Colorado, Utah, Connecticut and Virginia, to personalize your experience on Match Group platforms, including how you’re shown to other users and how others are shown to you, prices, discounts, ads and content you experience, to improve our marketing campaigns.
· For other legitimate business purposes including corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting.

The sharing of information laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use standard contract clauses (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism. We are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the recent Court of Justice for the European Union’s ruling on transfers of personal data to the USA.
We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind you of the following options and tools available to you:
· Access / update tools in the service. Tools and account settings can help you access, rectify or remove information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.
· Device permissions. Mobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone contacts, pictures, location services, push notifications and advertising identifiers. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.
· Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. Remember that uninstalling an app does NOT close your account. To close your account, please use the corresponding functionality on the service.
· Account closure. You can close your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.
We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:
· Access/know. You may have the right to request a copy of the information we keep about you, and in certain circumstances to receive this in a portable format. You can exercise your right to access by putting in a request here.
· Delete/erase. You may request that we delete the personal information we keep about you. You can exercise your right to delete by submitting a request here.
· Correct/rectify/update. You can correct most information you provided to us by editing your profile directly in the service. If you believe the information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may contact us here to rectify it.
· Object/restrict. You may also have the right to object to or request that we restrict certain processing. To do so, please contact us here.
· Opt-out of Targeted Advertising, “Sales” and “Sharing.”. As explained above, if you live in the United States, you may opt out of our activities that may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sales,” and “sharing” under applicable laws. To do so, please visit the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of our website and in the Settings menu of the app and set the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” toggle to the “on” position. Authorized agents may submit opt-out requests on behalf of consumers here.
For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other user will have to contact us to submit a separate request for their information. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.
Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.
If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, or Connecticut, USA, if we deny your privacy request, you may be able to appeal by contacting us here, and explicitly referencing “Privacy Request Appeal.” If you have concerns about the result of your appeal you may contact the attorney general for your state. Additionally, please note that we do not use your personal data for “profiling” in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, as those terms are defined by applicable law in your state, so no opt-out choice is necessary.
In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here, and in the United Kingdom here. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.
We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other users. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for a period of two years. After your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:
To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of up to three months following account closure. During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims. Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below: a. We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents users give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law. b. We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download / purchase for five years to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent users who were banned or people who were found to be under the age of 18 from opening a new account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our users. c. Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.
Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.
We also process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative of Plenty of Fish, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss the entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information, transfers of personal information, rights you may have under applicable law, how to contact us and California-specific information.
If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us. We use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we may process identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers that assist us with recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with Match Group companies (for instance if you have a business relationship with employees of an affiliate). We keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.
Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.

Your privacy is very important to us. We’ve prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how textPlus, Inc. (“we”) collect, use, protect, and disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, Message Data, and Contact Data when you use the textPlus and Nextplus websites (“Site”) and/or our SMS, instant messaging, voice telephony or other services (“Services”), such as our textPlus and Nextplus mobile applications. This Privacy Policy also explains your choices for managing your information preferences. By using the Site or Services, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Personal Information. We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, mobile telephone number, or e-mail address, and any other personally identifiable information that you provide us with or that you choose to include in any profile or account (“Personal Information”). You may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you register with the Site or any of our Services and at other times. The decision to provide certain Personal Information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or Services. You can delete or modify this provided Personal Information at any time via the ""My Profile"" feature.
Usage Data. We automatically collect usage information that does not identify an individual user (“Usage Data”). For example, when you download and use our Services, we may automatically collect information such as your device type, operating system version and type, certain device settings, device time zone, device carrier, current IP address, the presence of connected devices via BlueTooth, and platform-specific advertising identifiers. We may also collect location information, such as your device GPS coordinates unless you configure your device operating system settings to prevent our collection of location information. Additionally, each time you use the Site we may automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We use this information to enhance the services we offer, provide targeted advertising, and help us understand how people use the Site and Services. You can opt out of ads personalization and other associated services at any time via the system controls on your device.
Messages and Message Data including Images, Photos, and Audio & Video Recordings. When you send or receive messages using our Services, we process and store your messages, log and connection data, and other related information (“Message Data”) including images, photos, audio, and video recordings that you may choose to share via our messaging service. We process and store this content in order to provide these Services to you, so you can retrieve the content again when logging in to our services from a second device or when logging into our service again after logging out (much like an email provider). Your messages, and all their content, can be deleted at any time via the inbox feature by deleting the conversation. Additionally, you can delete all of this content by triggering the delete my account function in the settings from within the app. In any case, all stored message content including images, photos, and audio and video recordings are deleted from our servers after 36 months.
Contacts. With your permission, we will access your device address book and your contacts, including names, telephone numbers, email addresses, and social media handles, if available (“Contact Data”). This Contact Data is managed locally on your device and not collected or stored by our service.
Cookies and Web Beacons. We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser when you visit our Site or use our Services). We also use Web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage). We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Information. We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Site and Services. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies and Web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.
Location. In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect and share precise and/or approximate location information. This information may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers (such as advertising identifiers), and may be shared with other parties for purposes related to advertising, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance), analytics and research. You can withdraw your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device (note that certain services may lose functionality as a result). You can also activate your device’s functionality to reset or opt-out of settings for personalized advertising which will tell advertisers to not use your in-app information from that device for purposes of collecting and serving interest-based advertising.
HOW WE USE INFORMATION AND WHEN WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION
Generally. We use Personal Information, Message Data, and Content, and Contact Data for internal purposes only, such as to provide you with the Site and Services, to notify you of new products or Services, and to otherwise communicate with you. We will not disclose Personal Information, Message Data, or Contact Data to third parties without your consent, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.
We may use and share with third parties, including advertisers, non-Personal Information you provide in using the Services, such as general demographic and location information that does not identify you personally. Advertisers may use this information to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements on our Services and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. The use and disclosure of such non-Personal Information are not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy.
Service Providers. From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses that we believe are trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, customer relationship management, data storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your Personal Information, Message Data, and Contact Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information, Message Data, or Contact Data other than as specified by us.
Ad Networks. We work with third-party marketing and advertising companies (“Ad Networks”). These companies may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or third-party websites. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as Web beacons. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Ad Network may collect from you. It also does not cover any information that you may choose to provide to an Ad Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised through the Site or the Services.
Standard Analytics Information. We may use and disclose to third parties certain aggregate or anonymous Usage Data regarding the Site and Services. Again, such information does not identify you individually.
Other Transfers. We may share Personal Information, Usage Data, and Message Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with us. If our company is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information, Usage Data, and Message Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may therefore disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, Message Data, and any other information about you if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to our rights, property or safety, or that of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS
Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available profile page, community page, or any other public forum, this information may be accessed by the public. In addition, when you share information in SMS, WAP, instant messages, images, photos, or any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. That means anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.
SECURITY
We’re very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We employ measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site or Services, and you do so at your own risk.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
Our Site and Services may contain links to other websites or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third party’s website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. You access such third-party websites or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the website.
MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION PREFERENCES
You can always review, correct, update, or change your Personal Information or opt-out of our direct marketing efforts by changing the relevant setting in your profile or account (if available), or by contacting our Privacy Officer at privacy@textPlus.com. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at privacy@textPlus.com. You may also delete your account, which deletes all of the information we’ve collected, by triggering the “delete my account” function from within the app’s settings.

We are willing to continue to work with the industry to define a common understanding of how to treat “Do Not Track” signals.

This Privacy Policy covers HOLLA's treatment of Personal Information that we collect while you are using the App and the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that HOLLA does not own or control, including but not limited to third-party services you access through HOLLA, the App, or the Service, or to individuals that HOLLA does not employ or manage. As our Service integrates with third-party sites, such as Facebook, and other sites and social networks, we assume that you are already aware of the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when using our App and/or our Service and when you allow us to interact with these sites and networks on your behalf.
2.Information Collected
There are three basic ways we collect information: - Information you choose to give us
- Information you choose to give us - Information we get when you use our services
- Information we get when you use our services - Information we get from third parties Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.
3.Information Collected with your Consent and Permission
By visiting and interacting with HOLLA, its App, and/or its Service, you provide us with Personal Information which may include, but is not limited to, the following: - Personally Identifiable Information: may include, without limitation, the information provided when you register to use the App and/or the Service, including your name, profile picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, email address, gender, Facebook account info and friend list, and/or other social network usernames and ‘likes' and preferences, friend lists and a number of friends you have via social networks, messages to other users of the App and the Service, use information regarding your use of the Service, profile picture that you upload via the App or the Service, and browser information.

You have total control over your profile information, and you can access to modify it at any time. In addition, if you register to our service with your Facebook account (e.g., Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and the corresponding token on our servers. If you give us your consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email addresses, profile pictures, friend lists, and birthdays). Your Profile is open to other users of the Service who are connected to you on our service. In addition, unless you opt out (which you may do so at any time in the settings of our application), your Profile is discoverable by other users. You may “block” any user on our platform to prevent unwanted access to your Personal Information.

Of course, you’ll also provide us with whatever information you send through the services. Keep in mind that the users you send texts, images, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to HOLLA: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share. We’ll say it anyway: When you contact HOLLA Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.

Updated: July 31, 2023
This Privacy Policy (""Privacy Policy"") explains how Amino App, LLC (""Amino"" or ""we"" or ""us"") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile applications (""apps""), website, or other products or features we offer (collectively the ""Services""). By accessing and using any of our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.
This Privacy Policy applies to our Services that link to or reference this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or applications maintained by third parties that we may link to or that may be accessible to you through our Services.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
To provide you the Services, we collect the categories of information described below.
Information you provide us when using our Services;
Information we collect automatically;
Information we get from advertisers, third parties, and offline sources;
Any other information you choose to provide to us.
Most of the data collection and uses described in this Privacy Policy are necessary in order for us to be able to provide you the Services. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, we will not be able to provide you usage of the Services. Some of the data collection and uses are not strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but they are related, and our basis for such collection and processing is for legitimate interests we may have, such as to analyze and improve the Services as explained in more detail below. If you want to know how to exercise your rights to manage or delete the personal information we may have about you, please review ""YOUR CHOICES"" below.
Information You Provide Us When Using Our Services.
Account Information. When you sign up to become a user of our Services, we collect personal information you choose to provide us, which may include your name, address, email, and phone number. We may also ask you for, or you may choose to provide, additional information, such as age or gender that will be associated with your Services account. All of this information that may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device is called ""Personal Information"". Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records; (b) De-identified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act, such as: (i) health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.
User Content. We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others (collectively, ""User Content""). For example, we review the text and/or image content of your posts, replies, chat messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may collect the identity of the user and any users they communicate with. All posts of contents and replies are public and are publicly displayed (for information deleting content, please see ""YOUR CHOICES"" below). User Content may be viewed, shared and modified by our users, us and others for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the rights and licenses in our Terms of Service ). We collect information you choose to upload, sync or import from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know. Please keep in mind that if you include information that could identify you in any content you share or post, people who see it may determine your identity. Amino does not post chat messages publicly but, as with any message that you send via any service, the recipient might do so.
Your Purchase Transactions. If you make any purchases or engage in any other financial transactions through our Services, we collect information necessary to process the transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit card or payment account information; authentication information; and billing, shipping and contact details.
Information We Collect Automatically When Using Our Services.
Location Information. Many features of the Services will not work unless you provide us with some information about your location. If you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we will collect and use this information both while you are directly using the Services and in the ""background"" (i.e. at times when you are not directly using the Services). For example, we or our advertising partners may show you content or posts from people around you or places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with location information, or location information is not available from your device for technical reasons, we may use your IP address or information about the WiFi SSID from which you access the Services to determine an approximate geographic location for your device. For more details about how you may control the collection of location information, please see ""YOUR CHOICES"" below.
Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the Services, including access times, pages viewed, user and content interactions and other information about your interactions with our Services, as well as with other users, hashtags, and groups across our Services.
Device Information. We collect information from and about the devices and browsers you use that integrate with our Services. For example, we collect device type, which may include the hardware model, operating system and version, browser type and language, IP Address, plugins, app and file names and types, battery and signal strength, available storage space, unique device identifiers and mobile network information (which is treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your geographic area and to comply with applicable laws), information you give us access to through device settings such as photos, camera, or GPS location, identifiers associate with cookies, web beacons or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser. We may combine this information across different devices you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Services on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features you see when you use our Services on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different device.
Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Like most websites and applications, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us and our service providers to, among other things, improve our Services and your experience by seeing which areas and features of our Services are popular. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see ""YOUR CHOICES"" below. Keep in mind that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of some Services.
Information We Get From Advertisers, Third Parties, and Offline Sources.
We may receive information about you from advertisers, app developers, and publishers, or other online or offline sources with whom you interact and who have the rights to provide us with your information. For example, advertisers, publishers, and other third parties may share how you interact with their ads, websites, or apps, how you use their services, or what purchases you make. This information may be provided whether or not you are logged in to an Amino Service at the time. We may combine such information with the information you have provided to us in order to provide and improve our Services. We require each of these advertisers, publishers, or other third parties to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.
Any Other Information You Choose To Provide To Us.
You may provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, update your account, interact with the Services, apply for a job at our company, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.

The recipient may also choose to disclose your chat messages to others. If you post any User Content to the Services, other users may be able to see certain information related to your location. For example, other users may be able to see whether you are or were within a certain proximity of their current location or if you frequent similar locations. If you invite others to try our Services via SMS, email or otherwise, those individuals may see your name, phone number, email address or other contact information.

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS
As noted above, our websites, webforms, and mobile application will contain third-party content, links, and integrations. For example, when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links to an advertiser's website or app to learn more about their products and services. Through these integrations, you will be providing information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us. We are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use.
HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
How long we keep your information depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other similar factors. For example, we keep your information:
That you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.
For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
For as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is disabled for violation of our policies.
Indefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified (i.e., not capable of identifying you).
In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as required by applicable law.
If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete your information (see ""YOUR CHOICES"" to learn more). Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.
HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE
The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.
Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These are the risks of being online and conducting business online.
Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us via our contact form.
YOUR CHOICES
We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools to exercise control over the information we have about you. Keep in mind that each option is subject to applicable legal limitations. Additionally, because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional information before we let you exercise your choices over the information we have about you. We may also reject your request for several reasons, including, by way of example only, if the request risks the privacy of other persons or is unlawful.
Access and Portability. You can access and receive a copy of the information we have about you by completing our contact form and requesting ""Data Access Request.""
Correction or Modify (also known as rectification). You can correct or modify the information we have about you by completing our contact form and requesting ""Correct or Modify My Information.""

Marketing and Communication Preferences. If you wish to unsubscribe to any email communications we send to you, simply select ""unsubscribe"" in the emails. If you wish to unsubscribe to any text messages we send to you, text ""STOP"" in reply to any text message you receive from us.

Third parties that maintain their own marketing lists may send communications that advertise our Services. You must contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their communications.
Cookies and other Tracking Technologies. To learn more about your choices and how to exercise control over the information we collect from you automatically using cookies and other online tracking technologies, read Cookies and Other Technologies.
Deleting Account Information. Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly, so long as you or we do not delete them from the Services. You may choose to delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we will then remove them from the Services. However, it is important to note that your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our systems for a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and archived pages of the Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to copy or save them. Search engines and other sites may also index and cache content on our Services. You may have to contact these third-party sites or search engines directly to delete your cached information, subject to their policies and procedures. If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the ""Email Support"" link in settings from inside the applicable Product, or by submitting a request via our contact form. Remember that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted. As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for the safety of Amino (including its users) and others. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain limited period of time.
Deleting Location Information. When you first download or open any of our mobile application Services or access certain features of the Services, you will be asked to consent to the collection of location information from your mobile device or platform. If you consent to the collection of this information but later wish to withdraw your consent, you may do so at any time by either changing the settings on your mobile device or deleting our mobile application Services from your device.
Opting Out Of Cookies And Other Technologies. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Keep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time. Opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying customized advertising. In addition, opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. You will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services. When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device. Then when you visit the same Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out. This means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices from being stored. As a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out. We encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies. For more information on how to disable cookies on the most common browsers, we've assembled the following information for you below:

Specifically:
If you visit a third-party site that uses our Services, we will not place any cookies on your device unless you have provided your consent and been provided with notice of our privacy practices and your ability to opt-out at any time. We will not seek your consent to use cookies in this instance, though the advertiser or their website publisher may do so.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

VISITORS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our Services from residents of the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Where permitted by applicable law, we may transfer the personal data we collect about you to other jurisdictions other than where you reside that may not be deemed to provide the same level of data protection as your home country for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
By visiting or using our Services in any way, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy, regardless of the laws of your country of residence.
To the extent the laws of another jurisdiction apply to your data or use of our Services, we will comply with such laws. For example, for European Visitors, read the ""EUROPEAN VISITORS – COOKIES NOTICE.**""** section of Cookies and Other Technologies to learn more about our use of cookies and similar technologies with visitors from the EEA.
EU Visitors
If you are an EU citizen or UK citizen, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK-GDPR (collectively, the ""GDPR"") with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below. For this section, we use the terms ""Personal Data"" and ""processing"" as they are defined in the GDPR, but ""Personal Data"" generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and ""processing"" generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers' end users in connection with our provision of certain Services, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us via ourcontact form.
The legal bases for which we collect and use the information described above depends on what the information is and why we collected it. The four bases upon which we rely include:
Contract . This means we need the information to perform our contracted Services with you. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require that data.
Legitimate Interests . This means we have a legitimate interest that does not outweigh your privacy rights. When we collect and process information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy. For example, it is in our interest to protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement; to make sure you are satisfied with how the services work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect and use information about how you and others use the services and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use information in that request and, if relevant to the inquiry, information about how you access and use the services.
Legal Obligation . We may need to use your personal information to comply with a law enforcement preservation request, subpoena, or other legal process or to protect the rights of other users.
Consent. If we have no other legal basis for collecting or using your information, we will ask you for consent for a specific purpose. If we do, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not apply to any processing conducted in reliance on lawful processing bases other than consent.
In addition to other rights detailed in the policy (such as requesting deletion, correction or updating of your personal information), EU and UK citizens have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:
Right to Object or Restrict Processing. You have the right to object to or restrict our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes or under certain circumstances when the legal bases for using your information is based upon our legitimate interest. If you wish to object to our use of your information, you can send us a request to delete your account by using ourcontact form.
Right to Access or Erasure. You have the right to have your personal data erased and no longer processed. You also have the right to access the Personal Data we have collected about you. You can send us a request to delete your account or access your information by completing our Data Access & Erasure Form. Upon receiving the request, we will make a reasonable effort to delete your personal information from the Service and from our internal network within a reasonable period of time as long as we are not obligated to preserve your information due to things like law enforcement preservation requests, subpoenas, investigations, litigation, or otherwise meet any of our other legal obligations. We may also retain depersonalized information after deletion.
Withdrawal of Consent. If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of the Services. You can exercise your right to withdraw consent by completing our contact form.
Data Portability. You can exercise your right to export your personal data by completing our Data Access & Erasure Form.
File a Complaint. You have the right to complain to the data protection authority located in your Member State. To find contact details, click here.
As explained above, personal data collected in the EU or UK may be transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the EU and/or UK and processed by employees operating outside of the EU and/or UK who work for us, one of our business partners, or service providers. We have implemented sufficient GDPR compliant procedures to secure the transfer of your personal data to the United States. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States.
CHILDREN'S INFORMATION
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (""COPPA"") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13.
Additionally, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 in countries subject to the EU GDPR, unless exempted by individual country exceptions.
If you are under 13, or 16 where applicable, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the required minimum age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under the required minimum age may have provided us personal information, please notify us via our contact form.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice to our Services and will update the notice's effective date.

For example, from time to time we offer a free initial week to first-time Skout Premium subscribers. Eligibility for any such trial is limited to users who have not previously subscribed to Skout Premium, through either a current or prior Skout Premium account. If you are a previous Skout Premium subscriber and try to claim a free trial, you should be aware that Apple or Google may recognize your ineligibility. If so, you may not receive a free trial, but instead may be charged immediately for your first subscription month. This is a feature controlled by the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, depending on which platform you use for Skout Premium.
Purchases of Subscriptions are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are discontinued. We may change the purchase price for Subscriptions at any time, as well as the features included in Subscriptions. We reserve the right to stop issuing Subscriptions at any time and to set expiration dates for Subscriptions. Subscriptions may not be redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all unused Subscription time without refund or other compensation.
Right to Terminate Subscription
You have the right to terminate (or withdraw from) your subscription within fourteen (14) days of acceptance, for any reason. In addition, where required by law, your estate is entitled to claim a refund of the unused portion of your subscription if you die during the term of the subscription.
In order to exercise either of these rights, you (or, if applicable, your estate) must notify us by registered mail at The Meet Group, Inc., 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, Attention: Member Services, or by email at support@themeetgroup.com.com with a clear declaration of your decision to terminate your subscription.
In order to meet the termination deadline, you should send us notification of your exercise of the right of termination prior to the expiration of the fourteen-day termination period.
If you terminate (or withdraw) from your subscription, we will refund the payments we have received from you, minus any amount of Virtual Currency that you have consumed. If you wish to terminate (or withdraw from) your purchase of Virtual Currency, we will refund the payments we have received from you, minus any amount of Virtual Currency that you have consumed. If you are an Android user, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction. If you are an iOS, personal computer, or mobile web user, we will refund you by paper check or PayPal if you provide the proper contact information to process these payments. In no case will you be charged for this refund.
Virtual Currency and Gifts
When you purchase or receive Virtual Currency products such as Skout Points you do not own them. Instead, you receive a limited right to use them for eligible services and merchandise on Skout such as saving pictures and the purchase of virtual Gifts for other users.
You may use Virtual Currency to purchase Gifts for other users of our app or other apps which are visible to you. The price for each Gift will be displayed at the point of purchase. Gifts constitute a limited license to access a certain feature on the Skout platform when, as, and if allowed by us. All sales of Gifts are final and we do not offer refunds for any purchased Gifts. We are not responsible for repairing or replacing Gifts, or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that we modify, suspend, or terminate the Gift program, or for loss or damage due to any service error, or any other reason.
Purchases of Virtual Currency and Gifts may not be sub-licensed and are non-refundable and non-transferable, even if they expire or are revoked or discontinued. We may change the purchase price for Virtual Currency or Gifts at any time, as well as the ways you can use Virtual Currency and Gifts. We reserve the right to suspend, revoke, or stop issuing Virtual Currency and Gifts or permitting their use at any time without notice, refund, or compensation, and to set expiration dates for Virtual Currency and Gifts. Virtual Currency and Gifts may not be directly redeemed for any sum of money or monetary value. If you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason, you will lose all accumulated Virtual Currency and Gifts without refund or other compensation. You agree that we will have no liability to you based on our exercise of our rights with respect to Virtual Currency and Gifts.
Gifts purchased or received by any user do not constitute property and are not transferable.
Rewards
Each user who receives a Gift from another user during a video broadcast may get a number of Diamonds as determined by us. Users may redeem Diamonds for cash. A user must cash out at least two hundred dollars ($200) worth of Diamonds for each request, and may cash out only once per day. We may change the cash-out minimum increments and frequency from time to time, and we reserve the right to do so at any time without notice. We reserve the right to suspend, revoke, or stop redeeming Diamonds for cash at any time without notice, refunds, or compensation. We will also determine the rate of redemption in our sole discretion and we may change the rate from time to time without notice.
The rate will be displayed at the point of redemption. You agree that we have the absolute right to manage, modify, and/or eliminate such redemption feature in our sole discretion. The cost of the Gifts that you give to another user may not correlate to the amount of money such user is entitled to receive from us. You agree that we will have no liability to you based on our exercise of our rights with respect to Diamonds.
We may use a third-party vendor (e.g. PayPal, Inc.) for cash redemption. Users wishing to redeem Diamonds for cash must 1) have a valid PayPal account, 2) must agree to said vendor’s terms of service, as well as its policies and procedures, and 3) bear any charges that said vendor may impose.
User understands that all information submitted during the cash out process will be stored by vendor on vendor’s servers, and will not be under our control. You understand that we have no control over our third-party vendor’s practices and user releases Company from any and all liability associated with information submitted to our third party vendor, including, without limitation, liability related to the unauthorized release or use of user’s information. We reserve the right to verify your identity and eligibility to receive cash redemptions prior to payment.
All Diamonds, Virtual Currency, and Gifts in your account are forfeited if you delete your account or your account is terminated for any reason. You forfeit all Diamonds, Virtual Currency, and Gifts if we determine that you are abusing or fraudulently using Skout or any of its features and services, in our sole discretion. We will not reinstate any Diamonds, Virtual Currency, or Gifts you lose or forfeit, unless we have made an error, in our sole discretion.
All users who redeem Diamonds are solely responsible for the reporting and payment of any taxes due on the amounts redeemed.

Disputes and Arbitration
You agree that any dispute relating in any way to these Terms or Skout, including without limitation your or third parties’ access to or use of Skout, will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below and not through litigation in any court (except in small claims court if the claim is within the court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis). Claims are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist, or may arise in the future. This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1-16 (FAA).
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IF YOU TELL US WITHIN 60 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST DOWNLOAD OR USE OF SKOUT THAT YOU WANT TO OPT OUT. IF YOU WANT TO OPT OUT, SEND A WRITTEN NOTICE ADVISING US OF YOUR DECISION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENTAL TRIBUNAL.
YOU AGREE NOT TO (1) SEEK TO PROCEED ON ANY CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AS A CLASS CLAIM OR CLASS ACTION OR OTHER COMPARABLE REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE IN ARBITRATION ANY CLAIMS INVOLVING SEPARATE CLAIMANTS; (3) BE PART OF, OR BE REPRESENTED IN, ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION BROUGHT BY ANYONE ELSE; NOR (4) SEEK ANY AWARD OR REMEDY IN ARBITRATION AGAINST OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. IF THESE TERMS RELATING TO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEDURES ARE LEGALLY UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE INAPPLICABLE TO THAT CLAIM, AND THAT CLAIM WILL INSTEAD BE HANDLED THROUGH LITIGATION IN COURT RATHER THAN BY ARBITRATION. NO ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENTERTAIN ANY CLAIM ON BEHALF OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY, NOR SHALL ANY ARBITRATOR HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ANY AWARD FOR THE BENEFIT OF, OR AGAINST, ANY PERSON WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY.
Arbitration under these Terms and the Privacy Policy shall be conducted by a single arbitrator under the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, at the election of the party filing a claim in arbitration. That organization will apply its rules in effect at the time the arbitration claim is filed. If there is a conflict between those rules and this arbitration provision, this arbitration provision and the Terms will control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any current or future such rules or governing law, the arbitrator shall have no power to vary the terms of the Terms or to award either party attorneys’ fees. In the event that JAMS or the AAA is unable to handle the arbitration for any reason, then the matter shall be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties, pursuant to the AAA rules of procedure.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
We will pay any costs that are required to be paid by us under the arbitration administrator’s rules. Even if not otherwise required, we will reimburse you up to $500 for any initial arbitration filing fees that you have paid. We will also pay any fees of the arbitrator and the arbitration administrator for the first two days of any hearing. If you win the arbitration, we will reimburse you for any fees you paid to the arbitration organization and/or arbitrator. All other fees will be allocated according to the arbitration administrator’s rules and applicable law. If you are unable to afford any fees that you would otherwise be required to pay, you may request us to pay or reimburse them, and we will consider your request.
Rules and forms for filing an arbitration claim can be found at www.jamsadr.com or www.adr.org. Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district that includes your address at the time the arbitration is filed.
Permitted Time For Filing A Claim or Lawsuit
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of Skout or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
Indemnity
YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND OTHER PARTNERS, HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND, INCLUDING ANY ATTORNEYS' FEES, THAT WE (OR THE OTHER INDEMNITEES) MAY INCUR RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACTIONS AND/OR ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT YOU SUBMIT, POST, TRANSMIT OR MAKE AVAILABLE THROUGH SKOUT, YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF SKOUT, YOUR CONNECTION TO SKOUT, YOUR VIOLATION OF THE TOS, YOUR TRANSMISSION OF OTHER USERS’ INFORMATION OR CONTENT, OR YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF ANOTHER.

It is our policy to terminate in appropriate circumstances Account holders who repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and to terminate repeat infringers.

PRIVACY POLICY
‍Last Updated: Aug 10th, 2022
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of NGL Labs LLC (“NGL”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and how we handle personal information that we collect through our application, website and any other sites or services (collectively, the “Services”).
‍The basics
‍NGL allows users to receive anonymous messages through Instagram. This is how it works:
The NGL app permits a user (“App User”) to generate an NGL link and then use the link to solicit messages from anyone with access to the link (the person sending an anonymous message is a “Message Sender”).
‍When a Message Sender clicks on the NGL link, they will be taken to a URL where they can send a message directly to the App User. The App User also has the choice to post the anonymous messages and App User’s response to the App User’s Instagram account.
NGL does not store the name or Instagram handle of the Message Sender, and cannot reveal this information to the App User or to others. NGL may reveal properties of the Message Sender to the App User, based on the Message Sender’s IP address or browser user agent. Additionally, NGL may share this information for compliance, safety, and integrity issues.
To protect the safety of our users, we employ AI content moderation services like Hive Moderation. These services utilize deep learning and sophisticated algorithms to screen messages and filter out harmful language and bullying.
‍Personal information we collect
‍We collect information about you from a variety of sources, and the type of information we collect depends on how you interact with our Services – such as whether you visit our website, download the NGL app, or send messages to App Users through the Services.

‍Messages that Message Senders submit to App Users through the Services.
‍Feedback or correspondence, such as information you provide when you contact us with questions, feedback, product reviews, or otherwise correspond with us online.

‍Local storage technologies, like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.

Security practices
‍We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of personal information.

466,com.duckduckgo.mobile.android,DuckDuckGo Private Browser,Tools,DuckDuckGo,50M+,https://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html,"About Us DuckDuckGo (officially, Duck Duck Go, Inc.) has been an independent company since our founding in 2008. While we started as a search engine, our apps and extensions now offer protection well beyond search, including when browsing the web, reading email, and even using other apps. Trackers lurk nearly everywhere online, trying to scoop up your search history, browsing history, location history, and more. Even everyday online activities like purchasing groceries or looking up the local weather can result in dozens of companies tracking you. Other companies track your data — like your search and browse history — to create detailed profiles about you, and then use those profiles to follow you around with ads so creepy it can seem like your devices are listening in on you (even when they aren’t). These profiles are also used by companies to influence what you see online, which can lead to manipulation and discrimination. That’s why we offer an all-in-one privacy product as a privacy preserving alternative to products like Google Search and Google Chrome, to help protect your everyday online activities.
Privacy Policy We don’t track you. That’s our Privacy Policy in a nutshell. We don’t save or share your search or browsing history when you search on DuckDuckGo or use our apps and extensions. When you visit our search engine or our other websites, your device sends some information about itself automatically, like its IP address, browser type, and language, and may send additional information upon request like its screen size, operating system, and preferences. However, we only use this information temporarily to deliver content to you and, for security, to ensure you’re not a malicious bot. We don’t save your IP address or any unique identifiers alongside your searches or visits to our websites. We also never log IP addresses or any unique identifiers to disk. This means that when you use our services, we have no way to create a history of your search queries or the sites you browse. For example, we may know that we got a lot of searches for ""cute cat pictures"" today, but we don’t know who actually performed those searches. That is, viewing search results on DuckDuckGo is anonymous. And we only save these anonymous search queries — completely disconnected from any unique identifiers like IP addresses — for just enough time to analyze anonymous trends like popular searches, so that we can better serve you. For local search results in particular, we've further engineered a solution to shield your precise location from us and our content providers that sends us a random location nearish to you, which we also never log to disk. In the process of delivering our search results and other content, we also prevent our hosting and content providers from creating a history of your searches and browsing. At a technical level, we achieve this by calling for content (for example, images) on your behalf from our servers and then ensuring that content is securely delivered to you through an end-to-end encrypted connection. In order for our product to function, we share anonymous browser and device information with our hosting and content providers for security and display purposes (for example, that you’re using a mobile device), but we never share any information with them that could tie your searches or website visits to you personally, or that could allow them to create a history of your individual search queries or the sites you browse. The Internet works by routing information to you via your device's IP address. As such, we cannot prevent your device's IP address from being seen by your internet service provider, our hosting provider, or other internet providers in between (typically, there are one or more internet providers between any two points on the Internet). That is, these providers necessarily use IP addresses to route information. They may also use them for security purposes, such as preventing network attacks and limiting other fraudulent traffic. However, the encrypted connection between you and us prevents your search queries from being revealed to any of these entities. And if you use our apps and extensions, our Smarter Encryption also helps you use more encrypted connections when visiting other websites. Keep in mind that when you visit other websites by navigating to them directly, by clicking external links on our search engine, or by using our !bang shortcuts, the privacy policies and practices of those other websites apply, including any information you submit to them. While our apps and extensions provide many safeguards against online tracking, we can’t completely protect you when you visit other websites and apps. For example, if you browse Facebook, Facebook will know what you do on their site. Our Web Tracking Protections page details how our various protections function and their limitations.
We make money through private search ads. It is a myth that search engines need to track you to make money. We make our money from private search ads on our search engine. On most other search engines, ads are influenced by profiles compiled from your personal information, such as search, browsing, and purchase history. Since we don’t have that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you’re viewing, and not based on you as a person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. Viewing ads on DuckDuckGo Search is anonymous, like the rest of our search results (as described above). Ad clicks are managed by Microsoft's ad network and Microsoft has committed to not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile and to not store or share that information other than for accounting purposes.
We offer optional privacy-protecting features that require limited personal information to function. For optional features, we only request personal information necessary for the feature to function and only use the information for that purpose. Before you opt in to any optional feature, we always let you know what personal information we’ll need (if any), how we’ll use it, and how you can subsequently opt out. For example, our Email Protection is an optional feature that requires some personal information to work (namely, your email address), and all of this is explained in our Email Protection Privacy Policy.
We improve our product by using anonymous methods and by considering publicly available information. To improve and promote our product, we develop and use only anonymous methods to learn key insights. For example, we design anonymous experiments to test different designs. We also observe what people are saying about our product across social channels and may search for, review, and share this publicly available information internally for consideration.
We don’t track you through cookies or any other storage methods. We offer a variety of search settings that use anonymous cookies for storage, and also offer the option to configure search settings via anonymous URL parameters if you prefer. Similarly, we use local storage on your device for anonymous display settings. For instance, we might use local storage to anonymously remember the fact that you’ve already dismissed a prompt to install our app so that we don’t annoy you by showing it again. Related, the anonymous experiments described in the section above sometimes require us to use browser storage too, but we never store any information that could identify you or your searches. For example, we might use storage to make sure a design we’re testing doesn’t frequently change on you. Finally, if you use optional features, such as staying signed in to our Email Protection, we use only the minimal necessary storage to allow that feature to perform.
We protect and limit use of your data when you communicate directly with DuckDuckGo. If you voluntarily provide personal information to us directly, we protect and limit its use. We will limit its use by only keeping it for as long necessary for the stated purpose, and we will protect it by keeping it secure and deleting it when it is no longer required, unless a longer period is required by law. For example, if you opt to receive our privacy newsletter, we will ask for your email address and use it only to deliver that content. You can also unsubscribe at any time, at which point we will delete it. Similarly, if you reach out to us directly for support, to provide feedback (such as in a crash report or on our search engine), or for other reasons, we will only use your contact information to respond to you. In that process, your communication may be accessible to the software-as-a-service providers we use in our corporate systems (such as our company email and project management software). For information voluntarily provided in surveys, we sometimes use additional vendors for processing, though their access to personal information is contractually limited to what is necessary to perform their services. Finally, if you apply for a position on our team, any information you provide falls under our Recruiting Information Policy.
We respect and support your legal privacy rights. Critically, it's not possible for us to provide search or browsing histories linked to you in response to legal requests because we don't have them. Nevertheless, we will vigorously resist government efforts to compel us to produce the very limited personal information that we might have, for example, your email address if you subscribe to our newsletter. Related, there are scenarios where we may transfer this limited personal information (for example, your email address) to countries other than the country in which it was received. For example, we have servers across the world and while your device will typically try to automatically connect to regional servers (e.g., European servers in Europe, U.S. servers in the U.S.), you could be using a VPN from another country. Additionally, DuckDuckGo team members are also distributed worldwide, and while we have robust security and access controls in place, authorized team members access DuckDuckGo servers as necessary to operate our services. In such scenarios, if any cross-border transfers are necessary, we will follow applicable legal requirements. Privacy laws in some jurisdictions provide certain rights with respect to the limited personal information we may hold about you from our optional features or from your reaching out to contact us. For information about these rights, such as requesting deletion or a copy of your personal information, please review our Privacy Rights page.
We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children. Our apps and website are intended for a general audience, and we do not knowingly market to or solicit information from children under 13.
We do not sell your personal information. We have never sold any personal information. Period.",

Information We Obtain
We may obtain the following personal information about you when you interact with us, including but not limited to when you purchase a Samsung product, create a Samsung Account, register for or use a Service, contact Customer Support, visit a Samsung retail location, or while attending an event:
• contact information (including your name, email address, postal address, and phone number);• payment card information (including your name, card number, expiration date, and security code);• user coupon or gift card number;• date of birth;• demographic data (e.g., gender and age range);• information stored in or associated with your Samsung Account (including your Samsung Account profile, ID, username, and password);• username and password for participating third-party devices, apps, features, or services;• information you store on your device, such as photos, contacts, text logs, and calendar information, when you back-up your device or use a feature that requires collection (such as when you share it with other users);• recordings of your voice when you use voice commands to control a Service, or when you contact our Customer Service team;• transcripts of chat sessions, text messages, emails, and other communications when you communicate with us using these methods;• information about products and services you purchase, obtain, or consider; and• location data (including (1) the precise geolocation of your device if you consent to the collection of this data and (2) information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services).
We may obtain certain information about you from publicly or commercially-available sources and from third parties who perform services for us. We also may obtain other information about you, your devices, and your use of the Services, in ways we describe at the time we collect the information or otherwise with your consent.
Our Services collect some data automatically when you use the Services. We may obtain information by automated means, such as through browser cookies, pixels, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. Among other purposes, these technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services, (3) tailor the Services around your preferences, (4) manage and measure the usability of the Services, (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications, and (6) otherwise enhance the Services.
Information we may collect automatically includes information about:• your device, including MAC address, IP address, log information, hardware information, IMEI number, serial number, subscription information, device settings, connections to other devices, mobile network operator, web browser characteristics, app usage information, sales code, access code, current software version, subscription information, and randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifiers, such as Personalized Service ID (or PSID), and advertising IDs, including Google Ad ID;• your use of the Services, including clickstream data, your interactions with the Services (such as the web pages you visit, search terms, and the apps, services and features you use, download, or purchase), the pages that led or refer you to the Services, how you use the Services, and dates and times of use of the Services; and• your use of third-party websites, apps and features that are connected to certain Services.
Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or visiting www.allaboutcookies.org. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. The Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. Please note that without cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from all of the features of our Services.
In addition to the categories of information obtained by Samsung discussed above, our Services may generate data automatically when you use certain Services (e.g. Samsung’s face-clustering technology that allows the device to group together images of the same face from different photographs (“Face-Clustering Data”)), or may utilize data that you generate independently (e.g. registering biometric data such as fingerprints to unlock your device or verify you in certain Services, or when you register your wake-up command in our Bixby Voice service). All of this data remains on the device and is not transmitted to Samsung, nor does Samsung obtain or access this data. Samsung does not share this data with third parties. Face-Clustering Data will remain on your device until you clear the cache in your system settings, you reset your device to its factory setting, or you delete the photos from your device. You can delete your registered biometric data or your wake-up command from your device at any time in the applicable settings. Because Samsung does not have access to this data, Samsung cannot delete it.
Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services or help administer the Services. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. To learn more about Firebase Analytics, please visit https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics.
Through certain Services, both we and various third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
Our Samsung Ads service is designed to serve advertisements that are customized to users’ interests on Samsung and third-party platforms, devices, websites, and apps. Samsung Ads may deliver customized ads based on your demographic characteristics, preferences, choices, and interests by collecting certain information about your online activities as specified in this Privacy Policy. Please see the Samsung Ads Privacy Notice https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads for more information, including information on how to opt out of receiving customized ads from Samsung Ads.
Because Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests, and browsing context. These networks can track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information the ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

477,bbc.mobile.weather,BBC Weather,Weather,BBC Media App Technologies,10M+,https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/about/57854010,"BBC Weather App Privacy Policy Published 15 July 2021
1. What's in this policy?
This policy tells you:
what information we might collect about you
how we might use that information
when we might use your details to contact you
what information of yours we might share with others
your choices about the personal information you give us
2. What does this policy cover?
This policy covers the services that are offered by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
And sometimes it covers services offered by parts of our organisation that operate as separate companies. Such as:
BBC World Service, BBC Studios, BBC Studioworks, BBC Global News, BBC Media Applications Technology, BBC World Service Trading and TV Licensing and BBC charities.
But only when those services link to this policy or tell you it applies.
It's up to you to decide how much detail you want to know. We have just-in-time explanations that appear when we ask you to input your personal information. As well as what's in this Policy, a service might have a short privacy notice. In that privacy notice you can find key information on what we do with your personal information when you use that service. And if you're after more detail have a look at these topics.
What's not covered in this policy?
Our services sometimes link to services run by other companies' services, like opening a track from BBC Sounds on another music service such as Spotify. Those companies have their own privacy and cookies policies, so remember that the information you give them will follow their rules and not ours.
Sometimes you can access our services from other places, like a BBC Radio 1 YouTube page or the BBC iPlayer app on your connected TV. Make sure to check their privacy policy so you know how they will use your information.
3. How do you protect my personal information?
We're strongly committed to keeping you and your family's information safe. And to do this we design our services with your safety in mind. We also have dedicated teams to look after your information security and privacy.
At the same time, no service can be completely secure - if you have any concerns that your BBC account or personal information has been put at risk, for example if someone could have found out your password, please get in touch straight away.
Where we store your information
Some companies that provide services to us run their services from outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We only let that happen if we are satisfied with their levels of security. Keep in mind that when you give us personal information it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the UK and the EEA.
4. What types of personal information does the BBC collect about me?
We'll give you details about why we need your personal information and how we'll use it before you begin, unless it's obvious.
a. Information that you give us
We might ask for your name and contact details, your date of birth or financial details, depending on what you're doing. If you apply to take part in a programme on politics, for example, we might ask you about your political opinions. Information you give us might include information in a creation you share with us, such as people's names that appear in the creation.
When you register for a BBC account, or update your details or settings we ask for some personal information, like your email address and age.
b. Device information
Devices are lots of things like:
your computer
your mobile
your TV
your tablet
your voice-enabled device
IP (internet protocol) address
device ID
app ID
vendor ID
advertising ID
c. Location information
We collect information about your location when you use our services. This helps us to determine whether you're somewhere where our services are available, helps us to ensure we are fulfilling our Charter obligations and to offer additional features whilst using our products and services, such as a weather forecast for your current location.
Your location can be determined at a town or city level by:
GPS
IP address
Information about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access point information
What type of location data (for example Country, Region, City or Town) is collected depends on the product or service you're using, the device you're using (for example Apple or Android) and your devices' settings (whether permissions are enabled or disabled). For example, the BBC Weather app will ask for your permission (consent) to use your device's location to give you local weather. If you choose to add the BBC Weather app's widget to your device's home screen, we request permission to access your device's location while the app is closed or not in use. This ensures that the widget can continuously display the most up-to-date forecast for your current location. You can turn this on/off at any time via your device's settings. The BBC Weather app does not store nor share your device's location with anyone.
d. Information on your activities outside the BBC when you talk about us
Like if you've mentioned us in a Twitter post, we'll collect your Twitter handle.
e. Information on how you use our services
Like the articles you read and the programmes you watch.
5. How long will the BBC keep my personal information?
When you give us any personal information we'll let you know how long we'll hold it for. And always stick to these principles:
we only hold your information for as long as we do the activities we told you about or have a valid reason to keep it
we think about what type of information it is, the amount collected, how sensitive it might be and any legal requirements
we design our services so that we don't hold your information any longer than we have to
we may close your BBC account if you haven't used it in the last year. We'll send you an email to tell you that we plan to do this before we delete anything, so please check to see if we've sent you any emails about this
6. How can the BBC use my personal information?
We have to have a valid reason to use your personal information. It's called the ""lawful basis for processing"". Sometimes we might ask your permission to do things, like when you subscribe to an email. Other times, when you'd reasonably expect us to use your personal information, we don't ask your permission, but only when:
the law says it's fine to use it, and
it fits with the rights you have
We use your information for these types of things:
a. to deliver our services and to provide you with information about them
b. to deal with your requests, complaints and enquiries
c. to check if you're using BBC iPlayer and to keep the licensing database accurate and up to date
d. to personalise services and give you things more tailored to your tastes
Your BBC account lets you personalise your BBC online experience. To do that, ""Allow Personalisation"" is set to on when you create an account. If you're under 13 and create an account your personalisation is set to off. Information about how you use our online services is then connected with other information you give us to personalise your experience.
If you don't want us to do this, you can always turn personalisation off in your account settings. If you're under 13 you don't need to do anything.
e. to show you relevant advertising on another company's site
f. to help us understand what kind of services you might use
And sometimes how you might share things with other people
g. to recommend things we think might interest you
h. to show you advertising when you access a BBC service from outside the UK
Some of this advertising might be tailored to you.
i. to research and innovate
You're not a guinea-pig here, but knowing how you use our services could lead to the next big technology breakthrough.
j. to contact you about various things
We might use your information to contact you about different things, like:
to update you on any changes to the BBC's policies, practices and Terms of Use
to check with you about any service or activity you've signed up for. For example, we might tell you if your BBC account hasn't been used in a long time. Or it might be about creating a child account
to contact you about a creation you sent us, like things you've sent in to School Report news day
to answer you when you've contacted us, or to respond to a comment or complaint
to invite you to take part in surveys about BBC services, which are always voluntary
for marketing purposes
to send you notifications on your device depending on your settings
We'll only contact you when we need to or when you've given us permission.
We'll never contact you to ask for your BBC account password.
We'll only send you marketing emails or contact you about BBC programmes, services and your views on issues about the BBC if you've agreed to this.
Keep in mind, even if you unsubscribe, we may still contact you.
Will my personal information be used when the BBC advertises with other companies?
If you have a BBC account we might use information that we hold about you to show you relevant and targeted advertising for BBC services through other companies' sites, like Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Twitter for example. This could be showing you a BBC sponsored message where we know you have a BBC account and have used BBC services.
Where we do this, we will share your data in a hashed format with these providers so that, where you have an account on the same platform, you will see adverts from the BBC. In these scenarios, we are joint controllers with these companies because we jointly determine the purposes and means of processing your personal data.
We also assess certain characteristics of our audience members in order to find others who are similar to them to provide advertising to those individuals.
If you don't want to see our targeted advertising, you can set ad preferences in your social media companies' settings. Also, you can visit your BBC account and turn this off.
9. When does the BBC share my personal information with others?
We'll never sell your personal information. We do share it with others in these ways:
a. When you make something public
Like post a comment which the public can see.
b. When we use other companies to power our services
In order for us to give you quality experiences and to understand how you're using our services we often use other companies to process your personal information on our behalf. For example, sending you emails about things we think might interest you, to ask you what you think about our services, or to analyse data on how people use our digital services so we can improve them.
We make sure that your personal information is looked after as if we were handling it directly. We carefully select these companies, only share with them what they need to do the work and we make sure they keep your information secure.
c. When we share personal information with companies in the BBC family
d. When you use another company's service that connects to us, like voice-enabled devices and connected TV
You can access our services through a voice-enabled device, like Amazon Alexa, or a connected TV. You'll need to sign in to your BBC account to use BBC services on your connected TV. When you do this we'll share an identifier for your BBC account with the company who runs the service you are using. Make sure to check that company's privacy policy so you know how it will use your information. The BBC isn't responsible when you access a BBC service through another company's services. It's up to you if you want to access the BBC in this way.
e. When we do collaborative research
We do research activities and sometimes collaborate with research partners. Every now and then we share our content and data with them. This might include information we've collected about you. But we're careful about what we share and what our research partners can do with it.
f. TV Licensing
We share some personal information with TV Licensing, to check if you're using BBC iPlayer and to keep the licensing database accurate and up to date.
g. Sometimes by law we have to pass on your information to other organisations
We might also share your information if we have to by law, or when we need to protect you or other people from harm.
10. What's different for kids and teens?
The BBC has services that are kid-friendly and for teens.
Here's what happens when you use them.
a. Why do we collect information about you in the first place?
We keep information about you so that we can
b. We'll always tell you why we're collecting your personal information
We'll explain why and how we use it and for how long. It's called a ""privacy notice"". And if we need your parent or guardian's permission we'll give you clear details about what's needed at the time.
c. We can only use your personal information if we have a valid reason
d. We share personal information about you to others but we follow some rules
The main rule is we will never sell your personal information to anyone.
e. We might ask you to tell us your age
To make sure you use the parts of the BBC that are suitable for you. For example:
so that adults don't post comments on kid's message boards
when you want to get a BBC account
when you're watching a programme, like on BBC iPlayer, and it's a bit edgy
f. Sometimes we'll ask to get your parent or guardian's consent
You'll see a notification. We might also ask for some details from them, so that we can contact them. Other times we may contact your parent or guardian:
so you can get notifications from us
so we can show you more things we think you'll like, based on what you do
so you can post comments
so you can upload your contribution to us
g. Sometimes we'll tell your parents about your activities
For example, if you enter one of our competitions, we might contact your parent.
h. When we can contact you
Sometimes we need to get in touch with you but we'll always follow these rules.
i. It's safe to use us
It's our job to keep your personal information safe and secure. That's why we design our services with your safety in mind. And we're always looking for the best ways to improve this.
j. Human beings and not robots will make the big decisions that affect you
k. You might not be able to use our services if you're outside the UK
If you're outside the UK you might not be able to access some services. Like CBBC and CBeebies.
And you may not be able to get a BBC account. Sorry about that.
l. You're in control of how we use cookies and tracking
Cookies are small text files that transfer onto your device when you use a service.
We use cookies and tracking to get information about what type of device you're using to access our services and we record things like what sites you visit, your IP address (a unique number your device creates every time you connect to the internet) and to make things easier for you, like remembering where you got to in a game or what emoji you selected.
You can switch off some cookies and similar tracking technologies. Or your parent or guardian can do this if you're under 13.
m. What we do when you post, upload or share a creation
n. You've got privacy rights, the same as adults, so get to know what they are
You can:
If you're 13 or older, you can do this yourself, but not always. Sometimes we'll be asking for your parent or guardian to do that.
If you're under 13 your parent or guardian probably has to do it for you.
11. Can I delete my information?
This depends on what information you're talking about.
a. If you're talking about BBC account
You can delete your account. Your account information is immediately deleted. Keep in mind:
•we keep a record of how you've used our services, but this information can't be linked back to you
•we also keep anything you've uploaded or commented on
b. What about other information I've shared with you?
We might have collected other personal information that you might ask to be deleted that has nothing to do with BBC account.
12. What are my rights?
Remember, you're in control of your personal information.
Bear in mind, sometimes we might not be able to help. Like if the law tells us we can't or it forms part of our journalistic output.
13. How does the BBC use cookies and similar tracking?
a. What are cookies and tracking technologies?
Cookies are small text files which are transferred to your computer or mobile when you visit a website or app.
There are also similar pieces of tracking information we collect.
b. Why do we use cookies and other tracking?
To do a few different things:
to remember information about you, so you don't have to give it to us again. And again. And again
to keep you signed in, even on different devices
to help us understand how people are using our services, so we can make them better
to deliver advertising to websites outside of the UK
to help us personalise the BBC to you by remembering your preferences and settings. And your progress, so you can pause and pick up where you left off watching a programme even on a different device
to find out if our emails have been read and if you find them useful
c. What are the types of cookies?
Some cookies are always on when you visit us, and you can't turn them off unless you change your browser settings. We call these ""strictly necessary cookies"". We use them to make sure our digital services work correctly and are meeting audience needs and interests.
We also use functional, performance and advertising cookies to make your experience more enjoyable. You can switch these on or off at any time and you can always change your mind. We'll only use them if you've agreed.
Bear in mind there are some other cookies out there from other companies. These ""third-party cookies"" might track how you use different websites, including ours. For example, you might get a social media company's cookie when you see the option to share something. You can turn them off, but not through us.
d. How long do cookies last?
Some are erased when you close the browser on your website or app. Others stay longer, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so that they're there when you come back.
e. How do I control my cookies and tracking?
Strictly necessary cookies are always on when you visit us. On your first visit to us, we'll tell you about our other types of cookies and ask you to choose which cookies we can use. You can always change your mind by going to your settings.
Stopping all cookies might mean you can't access some BBC services, or that some of them might not work properly for you.
Another way to control some tracking is in the settings on your device.
14. How will I find out about changes to this policy?
We update this policy sometimes. If we make important changes, like how we use your personal information, we'll let you know. It might be a notice, an email or a message in your app.
If you don't agree to the changes, then you can always stop using our services, delete your account and stop giving us any more personal information. We'd be sorry to see you go.
Find out more and contact us about your rights.

5. Do Not Track Disclosures
Some web browsers may transmit ""do-not-track"" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our Sites do not currently process or respond to ""do-not-track"" (DNT) settings in your web browser. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
Certain third parties, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms, collect information about your online activities over time and across websites. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. Information about how to opt out from your data being used by third parties can be found above under ""Information collected by automated means.""
6. Social Media and Other Communications
We maintain a presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snap, Tik Tok and Pinterest. We may incorporate some third-party social networking features into our Services (including, allowing users to interact with others and share certain content and information on social media platforms) or utilize third-party provided platforms to publish or manage the Services or portions thereof. Through these platforms and features, we receive or may share information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well. In addition, some providers of third-party social media or blogging platforms we utilize have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them may collect, use and protect your information (e.g., if you establish an account with such platform providers directly). By using social features, you agree to those third parties' privacy policies and terms of use.
If you choose to communicate with us or another user through social features available on our websites or mobile applications or through our social media pages, or other similar communication or messaging features or services, such information may be made publicly available. For security purposes, please do not include any password, social security number, payment card or other sensitive information via these features. We have the right, but not the obligation to monitor messages and communications between and among users for security and training purposes. We may, but are not obligated to, remove any content we deem inappropriate.
7. Information for Individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA)

Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: you can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal information or to limit our use of it;
Deletion: in certain circumstances, you can request a right ""to be forgotten"" (this is a right to have your information deleted or our use of your data restricted). We will honor such requests unless we have to retain this information to comply with a legal obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it;
Portability: in certain circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to obtain a transferable version of your personal information to transfer to another provider); and

In addition, you may contact us here to request that we not disclose your personal information to third parties (other than those that are acting as our agent to perform tasks on our behalf, such as data processors). Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on the rights and freedoms of another person. For example, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.
For your protection, we may require proof of identity and verification before we can answer the above requests.
Legal basis for processing data
In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we rely to process personal information.
In some cases, we have a legitimate interest to process the personal information that we collect, such as to develop, administer and support our products and services; to operate, evaluate and improve our business; to facilitate and manage engagement programs; to promote research; to support our recruitment activities; or to facilitate a Corporate Transaction (including a sale of assets or merger or acquisition).
In other cases, we process personal information to fulfill our contracts with business partners, such as third parties that distribute our products.
It may also be necessary for us to process personal information to establish, exercise or defend against fraud, illegal activity, and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the services we provide.
Our processing of certain information may be necessary to comply with our legal obligations, and for reasons of public interest, such as with respect to adverse event and product safety reporting.
We may also process personal information as specifically permitted by applicable legal requirements.
If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal information, we will seek such consent at the time we collect your personal information.
International data transfers
We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For example, if you are located outside of the United States, we may transfer your personal information to the United States. The countries to which we transfer personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer personal information across borders, we consider a variety of requirements that may apply to such transfers.
Specifically, we may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area to:
Countries that the European Commissions has deemed to adequately safeguard personal information,
Pursuant to the recipient’s compliance with standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), or Binding Corporate Rules,
Pursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal information pertains, or
As otherwise permitted by applicable EEA requirements.
8. Information for Residents of California
If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA"") may provide you with rights that are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy regarding our use of your personal information. The CCPA Notice applies to ""Consumers"" as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights. See Sections 1 - 4 above to learn what information we collect from you and how it is collected, used and shared.
Access to Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:
The categories of personal information we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which we collected your personal information.
The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your personal information.
The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
A list of the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.

• The categories of your personal information we have sold.
• The categories of third parties to which we sold personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third party.
You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.
Data Deletion Rights
Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Note also that we are not required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.
Exercising Your Rights
To make a request for access, portability or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click here or mail your request for the attention of the Privacy / Legal Department to Clime Weather Services, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, NY 10011. California Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (""Verifiable Consumer Request"").
The Verifiable Consumer Request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
Opt-Out
There is not yet a consensus as to whether third party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites and mobile apps may constitute a ""sale"" of your PI as defined by the CCPA. To make a request to opt-out of sale under CCPA, click here. See Section 9: Online Privacy Choices and Rights to learn how you can exercise your rights regarding interest-based advertising.
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.
California's ""Shine the Light"" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if we share Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes you will be able to elect for us not to do so by submitting your request here (please include your name, mailing address, and email address).
To find out more about our ""do not track"" practices under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 22575, see the ""Do Not Track Disclosures"" section of this Privacy Policy.
9. Information for Residents of Mainland China
If you are a resident of Mainland China (“Mainland China”, for the purpose of this Privacy Policy, excluding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan), the PRC laws and regulations contain rules that are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy regarding our collection, use, transfer and retention of your personal information.
Principles of Collection
We only collect your information to the extent necessary to provide one or more of the Services, and will do so only by fair and reasonable means. The legal basis for collecting and using the information depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it. During your use of some features, we will collect your personal information after obtaining your consent. Unless the provision of such information is required by applicable laws and regulations, refusing to provide such information will only result in your inability to use the related features, and will not affect your use of other features.
Sensitive Personal Information
Access to sensitive personal information, such as contacts, exact location, camera, microphone and album, is disabled by default, and will only be enabled upon your express authorization. It is important to note that obtaining your authorization to access sensitive personal information is a necessary but not sufficient condition for us to collect certain information. Our acquisition of your authorization to access sensitive personal information does not mean that we will definitely collect your relevant information. We will only collect your sensitive personal information when there is a specified purpose and sufficient necessity and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For the collection and processing of sensitive personal information, specific consent shall be obtained from you.
We place great value on the protection of minors’ personal information. As required by applicable laws and regulations, any user under the age of 14 shall obtain the written consent of his/her parent or statutory guardian prior to providing sensitive personal information to us.
Information Shared with a Third Party
We will share your personal information with third parties only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unless explicitly authorized by you, we will not share any information that can be used to identify your identity (such as your name or email address). We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties. We will direct all such third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and not to use your information for any purpose other than that have been authorized by you.
Data Retention
We may retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. We may retain personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, which includes retention that may be required for regulatory purposes.
If we discontinue providing our Services, we will notify you of such change by sending a notification, posting an announcement, or other means, and delete or anonymize your sensitive personal information within a reasonable period. “Anonymization” refers to the irreversible erasure or removal of sensitive personal information that leads to the information owner being identified. Any anonymized information shall not be considered as personal information.
Your personal information collected from Mainland China will be stored in a location within Mainland China in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If it is necessary to change the location where your personal information is stored from Mainland China to another location outside Mainland China, the information transfer will be conducted in strict compliance with applicable laws.
Right to Delete Information
We will delete, and you have the right to request the deletion of, your personal information if:
the purpose of processing such personal information has been achieved or is unable to be achieved, or the personal information is no longer necessary for achieving such purpose;
we cease the provision of the Service, or the required information retention period has expired;
relevant authorization or consent is withdrawn by you;
the processing of personal information by us is in violation of any applicable law, regulations or agreement; or
any other circumstances as provided by applicable laws or regulations.
If the information retention period prescribed by law has not expired, or it is technically difficult to delete the personal information, we will cease the processing of such personal information, except for storage and any necessary measure taken for security protection purpose.

Device permissions
Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as camera and microphone as well as push notifications. Where applicable, you can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain Services may lose full functionality.
Uninstall
You can stop all information collection by the app by disabling call forwarding and deactivating your account by following the instructions on the Service's Settings screen and then uninstalling the app using the standard uninstall process for your device.

Notice to Nevada users
Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the ""sale"" of certain ""covered information"" (as defined under Nevada law) collected by operators of websites or online services.

These new laws will help protect the rights of users located in those jurisdictions. We will respect all new privacy laws and will ensure that we are fully compliant with any new or emerging privacy law, rule or regulation.

We may transfer your data from the United States to other countries in connection with the storage and processing of data to operate our business.

Marketing Opt-Outs
You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's (""DAA"") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ , and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA's opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (""NAI""). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ . Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.

The following explanations help you understand how we ensure this protection and which data is collected and for what purpose.
Types of Data collected
Among the types of Personal Data that MacroPinch Ltd. collects, by itself or through third-parties, there are: General Activity Data, Cookies, Location and Usage Data.
Other Personal Data collected may be described in other sections of this privacy policy or by dedicated explanation text contextually with the Data collection.

Use of MacroPinch Ltd. and sharing personal data
We also collect information that you do not actively provide us with. We store data in an anonymous form that include the behaviour of users when using our app. These include operating life, device and functions used. These analyses are available to us in anonymous form without reference to a specific user and only serve statistical purposes.
A transfer of your data beyond the cases mentioned above will not take place. Also, we will not use your data for advertising purposes or let them be used by third-parties.
Your personal information is not used by MacroPinch Ltd. for marketing and advertising or transferred to third-parties.
Location Services
If you allow these services we may detect your approximate current location. To achieve this, these services may use any of the following: Cell ID, GPS, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth beacons.
We use this information to provide location-based services, not to identify you. Location services are used to

Advertising and Personalized Content
Advertising is important to our provision of free and low-cost Services to you. We may share your personal information with our advertisers, advertising networks, or other third parties for direct marketing and promotional purposes. Additionally, GTI and its Stations, our advertisers, certain outside network advertising services, and other third parties may place cookies, web beacons, and other similar technology on your device to personalize your experience, collect information about your preferences, collect location information, and/or deliver customized advertising content.
Advertisers and other third parties involved in the delivery of ads to you may offer you opportunities to choose what type of information about you is collected, used, and shared, and how that is done. We do not control outside parties or the choices they may offer you – please contact them directly to learn about your choices.
To opt-out of receiving personalized advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices, the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising service doesn’t mean that you won’t receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your device that helps us recognize repeat visitors, personalize your experience, deliver Services efficiently, monitor how our Services are used, deliver customized advertising, and for other purposes.
We also use other digital technologies, including web beacons, pixel tags, or clear GIFs. These are small, transparent graphic images that are placed on a web page or in an email and used to monitor the activity of the user accessing that web page or email. These digital technologies are used for website traffic reporting, measuring advertising effectiveness, customizing users’ online experiences, and for other purposes.
Like most online operators, we use these technologies to collect information about our website and app users automatically, deliver Services, tailor your experience, monitor how our Services are used, improve them, and deliver customized advertising, as well as for other related purposes.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies. But if certain cookies are disabled, you may not be able to use all features of our Services. We do not currently respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signals.
Social Media
Our Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others. When you visit our online Services and engage with these plug-ins, the social media platforms can place a cookie or pixel on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online Services. If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our online Services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our online Services or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our online services with other users of the social media website. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. We may also interact with you on social media platforms. If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request services, or otherwise communicate directly with us on social media, we may contact you to interact with you. For more information about social media advertising and social media plugins from other social media websites, please refer to those websites’ privacy and data sharing statements.
Safeguarding Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 16 years of age.
Accessing Account Information
Certain Stations and Services may allow you to register for an account. If these functions are available, you may view your user profile and related information, update that information or delete that information or account. If you delete your account, we will delete information associated with your account, except as prohibited by applicable law or as needed to protect the rights and property of GTI and its users. Changes you make to account information may not occur in all copies or back-ups held by us or others, or if we determine that the change would be unduly expensive or burdensome. We may deny a request to access, change or delete account information if we believe there is a question about the identity or authority of the requester.
Retention Policy
Unless otherwise required by law, it is our policy not to retain Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for longer than is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The criteria we use to determine specific retention periods include whether you have provided your consent and have not withdrawn it; whether there are other legal grounds for the continued processing; whether you have objected to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; and whether retention or deletion is necessary to comply with legal obligations.
Information Security
We take steps to protect the security of the information you provide us. Yet, no security is perfect, and transmissions over the Internet are potentially vulnerable. Please use caution when disclosing your personal information.
Third Party Websites
If you choose to use any of the links we provide to third parties, you will be leaving our Services and going to a new site or platform. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, even if a product or site is linked to our Services and even if a relationship exists between GTI and a third party. Protection of your privacy at those other sites or platforms will be governed by the privacy policy at that site or platform. GTI and our Stations have no responsibility for the privacy policies or business practices of a third party we neither own nor control. Please take the time to read the privacy policies at these third-party sites or platforms. It is your choice whether or not to leave our Services and go to third-party sites or platforms.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change our Privacy Policy, we will update the date at the top of the policy. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. By using our Services following a change to this Privacy Policy, you accept our practices as described.

Advertisers and other third parties involved in the delivery of ads to you may offer you opportunities to choose what type of information about you is collected, used, and shared, and how that is done.

To opt-out of receiving personalized advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices, the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising service doesn’t mean that you won’t receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your device that helps us recognize repeat visitors, personalize your experience, deliver Services efficiently, monitor how our Services are used, deliver customized advertising, and for other purposes.
We also use other digital technologies, including web beacons, pixel tags, or clear GIFs. These are small, transparent graphic images that are placed on a web page or in an email and used to monitor the activity of the user accessing that web page or email. These digital technologies are used for website traffic reporting, measuring advertising effectiveness, customizing users’ online experiences, and for other purposes.
Like most online operators, we use these technologies to collect information about our website and app users automatically, deliver Services, tailor your experience, monitor how our Services are used, improve them, and deliver customized advertising, as well as for other related purposes.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies. But if certain cookies are disabled, you may not be able to use all features of our Services. We do not currently respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signals.
Social Media
Our Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others. When you visit our online Services and engage with these plug-ins, the social media platforms can place a cookie or pixel on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online Services. If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our online Services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our online Services or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our online services with other users of the social media website. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. We may also interact with you on social media platforms. If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request services, or otherwise communicate directly with us on social media, we may contact you to interact with you. For more information about social media advertising and social media plugins from other social media websites, please refer to those websites’ privacy and data sharing statements.

If these functions are available, you may view your user profile and related information, update that information or delete that information or account. If you delete your account, we will delete information associated with your account, except as prohibited by applicable law or as needed to protect the rights and property of GTI and its users. Changes you make to account information may not occur in all copies or back-ups held by us or others, or if we determine that the change would be unduly expensive or burdensome. We may deny a request to access, change or delete account information if we believe there is a question about the identity or authority of the requester.
Retention Policy
Unless otherwise required by law, it is our policy not to retain Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for longer than is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The criteria we use to determine specific retention periods include whether you have provided your consent and have not withdrawn it; whether there are other legal grounds for the continued processing; whether you have objected to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; and whether retention or deletion is necessary to comply with legal obligations.
Information Security
We take steps to protect the security of the information you provide us. Yet, no security is perfect, and transmissions over the Internet are potentially vulnerable. Please use caution when disclosing your personal information.
Third Party Websites
If you choose to use any of the links we provide to third parties, you will be leaving our Services and going to a new site or platform. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, even if a product or site is linked to our Services and even if a relationship exists between GTI and a third party. Protection of your privacy at those other sites or platforms will be governed by the privacy policy at that site or platform.

Advertising is important to our provision of free and low-cost Services to you. We may share your personal information with our advertisers, advertising networks, or other third parties for direct marketing and promotional purposes. Additionally, GTI and its Stations, our advertisers, certain outside network advertising services, and other third parties may place cookies, web beacons, and other similar technology on your device to personalize your experience, collect information about your preferences, collect location information, and/or deliver customized advertising content.
Advertisers and other third parties involved in the delivery of ads to you may offer you opportunities to choose what type of information about you is collected, used, and shared, and how that is done. We do not control outside parties or the choices they may offer you – please contact them directly to learn about your choices.
To opt-out of receiving personalized advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices, the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising service doesn’t mean that you won’t receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your device that helps us recognize repeat visitors, personalize your experience, deliver Services efficiently, monitor how our Services are used, deliver customized advertising, and for other purposes.
We also use other digital technologies, including web beacons, pixel tags, or clear GIFs. These are small, transparent graphic images that are placed on a web page or in an email and used to monitor the activity of the user accessing that web page or email. These digital technologies are used for website traffic reporting, measuring advertising effectiveness, customizing users’ online experiences, and for other purposes.
Like most online operators, we use these technologies to collect information about our website and app users automatically, deliver Services, tailor your experience, monitor how our Services are used, improve them, and deliver customized advertising, as well as for other related purposes.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies. But if certain cookies are disabled, you may not be able to use all features of our Services. We do not currently respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signals.
Social Media
Our Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others. When you visit our online Services and engage with these plug-ins, the social media platforms can place a cookie or pixel on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online Services. If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our online Services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our online Services or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our online services with other users of the social media website. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. We may also interact with you on social media platforms. If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request services, or otherwise communicate directly with us on social media, we may contact you to interact with you. For more information about social media advertising and social media plugins from other social media websites, please refer to those websites’ privacy and data sharing statements.
Safeguarding Children’s Privacy

Accessing Account Information
Certain Stations and Services may allow you to register for an account. If these functions are available, you may view your user profile and related information, update that information or delete that information or account. If you delete your account, we will delete information associated with your account, except as prohibited by applicable law or as needed to protect the rights and property of GTI and its users. Changes you make to account information may not occur in all copies or back-ups held by us or others, or if we determine that the change would be unduly expensive or burdensome. We may deny a request to access, change or delete account information if we believe there is a question about the identity or authority of the requester.
Retention Policy
Unless otherwise required by law, it is our policy not to retain Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for longer than is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The criteria we use to determine specific retention periods include whether you have provided your consent and have not withdrawn it; whether there are other legal grounds for the continued processing; whether you have objected to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; and whether retention or deletion is necessary to comply with legal obligations.
Information Security
We take steps to protect the security of the information you provide us. Yet, no security is perfect, and transmissions over the Internet are potentially vulnerable. Please use caution when disclosing your personal information.
Third Party Websites
If you choose to use any of the links we provide to third parties, you will be leaving our Services and going to a new site or platform. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, even if a product or site is linked to our Services and even if a relationship exists between GTI and a third party. Protection of your privacy at those other sites or platforms will be governed by the privacy policy at that site or platform.

Cookies and Similar Technologies
A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your device that helps us recognize repeat visitors, personalize your experience, deliver Services efficiently, monitor how our Services are used, deliver customized advertising, and for other purposes.
We also use other digital technologies, including web beacons, pixel tags, or clear GIFs. These are small, transparent graphic images that are placed on a web page or in an email and used to monitor the activity of the user accessing that web page or email. These digital technologies are used for website traffic reporting, measuring advertising effectiveness, customizing users’ online experiences, and for other purposes.
Like most online operators, we use these technologies to collect information about our website and app users automatically, deliver Services, tailor your experience, monitor how our Services are used, improve them, and deliver customized advertising, as well as for other related purposes.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies. But if certain cookies are disabled, you may not be able to use all features of our Services. We do not currently respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signals.
Social Media
Our Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others. When you visit our online Services and engage with these plug-ins, the social media platforms can place a cookie or pixel on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online Services. If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our online Services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our online Services or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our online services with other users of the social media website.

If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request services, or otherwise communicate directly with us on social media, we may contact you to interact with you.

If you delete your account, we will delete information associated with your account, except as prohibited by applicable law or as needed to protect the rights and property of GTI and its users. Changes you make to account information may not occur in all copies or back-ups held by us or others, or if we determine that the change would be unduly expensive or burdensome. We may deny a request to access, change or delete account information if we believe there is a question about the identity or authority of the requester.
Retention Policy

The criteria we use to determine specific retention periods include whether you have provided your consent and have not withdrawn it; whether there are other legal grounds for the continued processing; whether you have objected to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; and whether retention or deletion is necessary to comply with legal obligations.

Advertising and Personalized Content
Advertising is important to our provision of free and low-cost Services to you. We may share your personal information with our advertisers, advertising networks, or other third parties for direct marketing and promotional purposes. Additionally, GTI and its Stations, our advertisers, certain outside network advertising services, and other third parties may place cookies, web beacons, and other similar technology on your device to personalize your experience, collect information about your preferences, collect location information, and/or deliver customized advertising content.
Advertisers and other third parties involved in the delivery of ads to you may offer you opportunities to choose what type of information about you is collected, used, and shared, and how that is done. We do not control outside parties or the choices they may offer you – please contact them directly to learn about your choices.
To opt-out of receiving personalized advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices, the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising service doesn’t mean that you won’t receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your device that helps us recognize repeat visitors, personalize your experience, deliver Services efficiently, monitor how our Services are used, deliver customized advertising, and for other purposes.
We also use other digital technologies, including web beacons, pixel tags, or clear GIFs. These are small, transparent graphic images that are placed on a web page or in an email and used to monitor the activity of the user accessing that web page or email. These digital technologies are used for website traffic reporting, measuring advertising effectiveness, customizing users’ online experiences, and for other purposes.
Like most online operators, we use these technologies to collect information about our website and app users automatically, deliver Services, tailor your experience, monitor how our Services are used, improve them, and deliver customized advertising, as well as for other related purposes.
You may configure your browser to reject cookies. But if certain cookies are disabled, you may not be able to use all features of our Services. We do not currently respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signals.
Social Media
Our Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others. When you visit our online Services and engage with these plug-ins, the social media platforms can place a cookie or pixel on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online Services. If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our online Services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our online Services or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our online services with other users of the social media website. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. We may also interact with you on social media platforms. If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request services, or otherwise communicate directly with us on social media, we may contact you to interact with you. For more information about social media advertising and social media plugins from other social media websites, please refer to those websites’ privacy and data sharing statements.
Safeguarding Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 16 years of age.
Accessing Account Information
Certain Stations and Services may allow you to register for an account. If these functions are available, you may view your user profile and related information, update that information or delete that information or account. If you delete your account, we will delete information associated with your account, except as prohibited by applicable law or as needed to protect the rights and property of GTI and its users. Changes you make to account information may not occur in all copies or back-ups held by us or others, or if we determine that the change would be unduly expensive or burdensome. We may deny a request to access, change or delete account information if we believe there is a question about the identity or authority of the requester.
Retention Policy
Unless otherwise required by law, it is our policy not to retain Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information for longer than is reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The criteria we use to determine specific retention periods include whether you have provided your consent and have not withdrawn it; whether there are other legal grounds for the continued processing; whether you have objected to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; and whether retention or deletion is necessary to comply with legal obligations.
Information Security
We take steps to protect the security of the information you provide us. Yet, no security is perfect, and transmissions over the Internet are potentially vulnerable. Please use caution when disclosing your personal information.
Third Party Websites
If you choose to use any of the links we provide to third parties, you will be leaving our Services and going to a new site or platform. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, even if a product or site is linked to our Services and even if a relationship exists between GTI and a third party. Protection of your privacy at those other sites or platforms will be governed by the privacy policy at that site or platform. GTI and our Stations have no responsibility for the privacy policies or business practices of a third party we neither own nor control. Please take the time to read the privacy policies at these third-party sites or platforms. It is your choice whether or not to leave our Services and go to third-party sites or platforms.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change our Privacy Policy, we will update the date at the top of the policy. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. By using our Services following a change to this Privacy Policy, you accept our practices as described.
